Cut upon the draft, the wind whistled through the window crack.

Xavier leaned his head agaisnt the wall while his hand rested on the window sill.
He looked towards the bar counter. There sat two women and a man. One woman wore a greened forest blouse lined in gold and the other a black dress with scarlet lines. 

The woman in black leaned over to her partner sitting in the next bar seat. 
	"He has flounded darling."
The man looked befuddled. 
	"Madam, what a generous offer, we will get the papers straight away."
The woman in black looked back at the man.
	"You know what day we are arriving?"
He looked back and answered half determined in his conviction.
	"Certainly. Monday, 3 from today. The room will be clear, setup, the boxes open."
The woman in green interjected.
	"No, closed and locked."
The man's response was servile. 
	"Yes, madam."
The woman in black smiled.
	"Thank you, Lester."

Lester turned around from the counter and met the eyes of Xavier. 
Lester quickly looked away, slicked his hair, and left the room. 

Xavier stayed sitting and mused at the golden border design of the green carpet. 
The salon on the 80th story of Manchester Tower was spacious and well lit.  Winter light shone through the large windows and lit the gold trim on the ceiling's edge. Wood paneled walls sided the double doors that Lester walked through. These things pleased Xavier.

The women had not seemed to notice him. They talked intently about Monday's event. 

Krista looked out the window past Xavier. The man seemed translucent against the windows and passed Krista's attention. She looked to her left and reflected:
"Rachel, these days bask in light. Yet, beyond those windows is cold. We forget fear drives the world."

~~

Sea side views rattled past the dinning car windows of the South Bound train. One passenger in a black long coat turned from the counter towards the car. "Hey, you like a drink?"

A kid sitting under his gaze looked up.

"Uhm, me? Well, I"

The man brought his hands together and touched a ruby stone held on a charcole black ring.
"The kid think I would get him a drink. How strange." The man laughed. So did the boy until his head hung down. Behind him a woman with black hair spoke.

"Kastile, get what I want."
"Sure."

Xavier sat to the side and looked on. Kastile was a supplier for the endevours of Rachel and Krista. What substance they dealt with he did not know. All he had was intutition and calling to follow. What else was an angel to do?

He supposed he could guard and inspire. Anything he pursued would lead to a culmination of time.

Rachel sang and swung her arms. She reached forward and guided a breeze through a tree. Krista, who walked next to her, rolled her eyes. Hands at her side Krista gestured a tight pull. The wind chilled and blew harder. Green leaves began to fall. They fell until the ground was a circle of green and the tree bare. 

Rachel laughed, 
	"How beautiful!"
Krista sighed,
	"You exasperate me."
Rachel thought for a moment,
	"You know, I don't wish to sulk all day. I can't see how you
	find that enjoyable."
To this Krista smiled,
	"My dear, you'll learn it is the only thing enjoyable."
This amused Rachel,
	"I hope not!"
Krista sighed again,
	"That power which drives you: You tire of it. For good or worst, in the
	end the world stays it's course. Hopelesly driven towards the satisfaction 
	of it's mind. People think lust is a physical sensation. I think not. More often they lust for their stories; They work long hours to afford their ideas. In the past they would drink. Not for the sensation, no, not for the headaches, but for their ideas of power. Now they paste their eyes with tar to blind themselves from reality. For moments they live in the creation of their minds. Who cares for sensation when one can be satisfied with an idea?"
Rachel blew through her lips,
	"But ideas are useless in themselves."
Krista laughed,
	"Not if you can return to them! Of course, that's the business we're in.
	We let them create worlds they can return to. How exciting that Monday it all begins."

~~

Rachel sighed and pulled her seeing lenses before her eyes. She did not this part of their project. She thought:
	"Actually, I like everything but making it happen."
The architecture of the plan was intricate; Planned in words and unfolded by words.

Then, by her intention, stairs appeared. The walls rose and windows floated into place. Still, beyond the glass: Darkness. A carpet unrolled and a ceiling came down to cover the emptyness. The banquet hall gleamed by the light passing through the windows. She smiled and flashed to the indoor balcony. 

Rachel thought,
	"The most enjoyable was my creation of this ballroom structure. Amazing, these powers Krista emparted to me. Look Rachel, the columns arise from green ferns and hold the edges of a domed ceiling. The carpets, red, spread across the floor. Now, I think, 'Tables appear!' And look, they appear."  


Suddenly Krista walked through the door. An electronic duo appeared on a corner stage. On held his head phones in one hand. The other's hung around his neck. Their hands moved with synthetic beats. 

Many people followed Krista. They kept walking through the door even as Krista assended the stairs towards Rachel. 
	"They cannot resist."
"I suppose we would not do this if they could."
Krista agreed,
	"Yes."
Krista paused and turned her head,
	"Rachel, who is that?" 

Krista looked to the figure on the other side of the stairs. He leaned over the railing and seemed to watch the revelers below.
Rachel answered:	
	"I don't know. He was sitting by the window when we last met with Lester."

"You're good. I didn't pick that up."
"Yes...he seemed to blend in. He has that peculiar quality."

Krista tapped the side of her lip.
	"Rachel, please have a chat with him. I would not want any hinderence in our plans." 

Rachel raised her eye brows, flicked her feet, and walked casually along the banister.

Kastile bent his head and walked into the tunnel. Orange light glowed along the walls. His boots skuffed against the dirt floor. His hand raised to the outside of his long coat then fell back to his side. Nausious. Scoundrel depravity. Kastile spit.

The tunnel opened to a cavern. Kastile straightened, placed his hands behind his back, raised his head and looked down accross the cavern.

Blue ether stone illumed the cavern in subdued glow. The farthest reaches twinkled like the night. 

Kastile turned is head and looked down on his ruby ring. It glowed deep red.

A hunched form tottered towards him. 

"Eh, master. We have been good digging for you."
Kastile looked up from his ring. 
"So you say?"
"Yes'm."
"Excellent. How much?"
"Lots, lots, lots."
The figure's face held still in the shadows. It's eyes flickered in the dimness:
	Orange, Blue
	Blue, Orange
	Black, Black on a blink.
	Blue, Orange
"Keep up the work."
"Oh yes'm, yes."

The creature swayed backwards and forwards in anticipation. Kastile rached into his long coat pocket and pulled out a paper package. 

The creature cooed.
	"Yes'm, please."
Kastile eyed the creature in distain.
	"How maleable", he thought.
Then Kastile asked,
	"The stone is in the loading bay, yes?"
It turned anxiously on it's feet.
	"Ohh"  "Yes, sire," it managed.

"Okay."
Kastile let the package fall.

The creature yelped and fell on it's knees. It's sense of time slowed. 
The package was tied with twine. Both hands held the bow ends and pulled. The loops vanished in themselves and the creature unfolded the package onto the floor.
In the middle of the paper lay a cloth bag. It's finger's spread open the top.
Color seemed to drain into the bag's mouth. It's fingers, once illumed by the orange tunnel lights turned black and white. It bent it's head closer. While it's back shone blue from the ether stone behind it, the orange light fled. It dipped two fingers into the bag and widthdrew blackened paste. It's mouth mumbled words as it spread the paste over it's eyes. 

From the tunnel's overlook Kastile walked into the twilight of the cavern. He followed a path outlined by ether stone. "How faithful these creatures are," he thought, "Within their anguish they remain in hope to satisfy their mind."

Xavier sat up and opened his eyes. He observed the
