Cut upon the draft, the wind whistled through the window crack.

Xavier leaned his head agaisnt the wall. His left arm rested on the window
sill.  He looked towards the bar counter. There sat two women and a man. One
woman wore a blouse of forest green lined in gold and the other a black dress
with scarlet lines.

The woman in black leaned over to her partner sitting in the next bar seat.
	"He has flounded darling."
The man standing in front of the bar worked to maintain composure.
	"Madam, what a generous offer. I, ...we will get the papers straight
	away."
The woman in black looked at the man.
	"You know what day we are arriving?"
He looked back, half determined in his conviction, and answered.
	"Certainly. Monday, 3 days from today. The room will be clear, setup,
	the boxes open."
The woman in green interjected.
	"No, closed and locked, thank you."
The man's gave a servile response.
	"Yes, madam."
The woman in black smiled.
	"Thank you, Lester."

Lester turned from the counter and met the eyes of Xavier. Lester avoided
his gaze, slicked his hair, and left the room.

Xavier stayed sitting and mused at the golden border design of the green
carpet.  The salon on the 80th story of Manchester Tower was spacious and
well lit.  Winter light shone through the large windows and lit the gold
trim on the ceiling's edge. Wood paneled walls sided the double doors that
Lester walked through. These things pleased Xavier. Particuarly the way the
light seemed to collect within the empty glasses on the self behind the bar.

The women had not seemed to notice him. They talked intently about Monday's
event.

Krista looked out the window past Xavier. The man seemed translucent
against the windows and passed Krista's attention. She looked to her left
and reflected:
	"Rachel, these days bask in light. Yet, cold is beyond those
	windows. We forget fear drives the world."

~~

Sea side views rattled past the dinning car windows of the South Bound
train. One passenger in a black long coat turned from the counter towards
the car. "Hey, you like a drink?"

A kid sitting under his gaze looked up.

"Uhm, me? Well, I..."

The man brought his hands together and touched a ruby stone held on a
black ring.

The man laughed.
	"The kid thinks I would get him a drink. How strange."
The boy also laughed, then hung his head.

Behind him a woman with black hair spoke.
	"Kastile, get what I want."
The man in black replied.
	"Sure."

Xavier sat a few seats down. He was turned away. Kastile was a supplier
for the endevours of Rachel and Krista, but Exaier did not know for
what. All Xavier had was an intutition and calling to follow. What
else was an angel to do?  He pursued all things in goodness and
faith. It followed that anything he pursued lead to a fullness in
time. But of these things his did not think; he was an intuative being.
Sometimes he guided women and men to success. Other times he withheld
achievement and supplied sadness. Xavier was glad at the places
he appeared. In these matters Xavier did not think or choose.  What little
he did think were reflections of a lightened heart. Occasionally
he became confused at the humans he encountered. But his intuition
reminded him that humans had choice.  What Xavier enjoyed the most
were the effects of light: The dance of light through tree branches,
the reflections on a lake. Of course, he did not know he 'liked'
these things. Rather they attracted him in unspoken whispers.  They happened 
and he was glad. When they didn't, they might happen again.

At this moment he was etheral. Humans could not see him. Still some humans could
feel his presance. Spectres, the dark compliment of angels, however, could
see him. But they could not tell whether he was human or spirit until he
revealed himself. It is not so much that an angel's light is hidden, but
that a spectre's eyes are veiled to see only what they wish to see. On the
other hand, angels readily recognize dark spirits.

At this moment the spectre at the train's bar counter was in human form.

Kastile walked back to his seat next to the human woman. She smiled and took
the drink. Kastile sat straight and expectentally. The woman tried to match
Kastile's dominating precence, but her eyes wavered and after a moment her back bent 
and betrayed her burden.

Rachel sang and swung her arms. She reached forward and guided a breeze
through a tree. Krista, who walked next to her, rolled her eyes. Hands at her
side Krista gestured a tight pull. The wind chilled and blew harder. Green
leaves began to fall. They fell to the ground until there was a circle of
green beneath a bare tree.

Rachel laughed,
	"How beautiful!"
Krista's eyes glanced sideways,
	"You exasperate me."
Rachel thought for a moment,
	"You know, I wish you would not sulk all day. I can't see how you do that.
To this Krista smiled,
	"My dear, you'll learn it is the only thing enjoyable."
That sounded amusing,
	"I hope not!"
Krista sighed,
	"That power which drives you: You tire of it. For good or worst,
	in the end, the world stays it's course; hopelesly driven towards the
	satisfaction of it's mind. People think lust is a physical yearning. I
	think not. More often humans they lust for their stories to be admired; 
	They work long hours to afford their ideas of self. In the past they would 
	drink. Not for the sensation, no, and certainly not for the headaches. But 
	many drink for ideas of power. Now, in our current age, they paste their 
	eyes with tar to blind themselves from reality. For moments they live in the 
	creation of their minds. Who cares for sensation when one can be satisfied with an idea?"

Rachel blew through her lips,
	"But ideas are useless in themselves."
Krista laughed,
	"Not if you can return to them! Or if you forget they are useless. Of
	course, that's the business we're in, We let them create worlds they
	can return to. How exciting that Monday it all begins. Don't forget that.
	You are not making worlds for fun. You make worlds for me. Without me you
	would not be able to lift a leaf from the floor."
To this Rachel stampered,
	"I might still be happy."
Krista smiled low and glared at Rachel. Krista's eyes seemed to flicker.
	"After what you've tasted you will never see the world the same." 

~~

Rachel sighed and pulled her seeing lenses before her eyes. She did not this
part of their project. She thought:
	"Actually, I like everything but making it happen."
The architecture was planned in words and unfolded by words.

Rachel stood on a dark canvas. It felt like standing in the spotlight of a
stage except there was no light. Then, by her intention, stairs appeared. The
walls rose and windows floated into place. Still, beyond the glass: Darkness. A
carpet unrolled and a ceiling came down to cover the emptyness. Light fixtures
unraveled from their chains. Rachel moved plants against the columns and
into the corners. The banquet hall gleamed in the daylight passing through
the windows. She smiled and flashed to the indoor balcony and leaned on
the railing.

"I really enjoyed creating this ballroom structure," she thought. "Amazing,
these powers Krista emparted to me. Look Rachel, the columns arise from green
ferns and hold the edges of a domed ceiling. The carpets, red, spread across
the floor. I think, 'Tables appear!' And look, they appear." She took mental
note of the timing. Not physical time, for in this place time held little
meaning. Rather she noted Krista's momentary intentions. "Soon the whole
reason for our little creation appears"

Rachel walked about finishing the final touches: A glimmer in the window
and a view of the 'outdoors garden'. If one looked closely one might see
uncertainty in the roses. Ever so often they flickered in color as if they
were insecure in the color chosen for them.

An electronic duo appeared on a corner stage. A hum arose. The two musicians
tinkered on their devices. On held her head phones in one hand. The other's
arched over his head. The hum paused and they flicked their devices in
time. The lights dimmed. The synths pulsed and the walls ocillated in subtle
color. The windows became shaded and provided a slight ambient light.

Then on a falling beat the door flung open and in Krista walked. She wore
a slim, long black dress with a cut down her left arm. Red trimmed the v
of the collar. She smiled, stepped aside, and turned around to watch the
entrance of the customers. Many people followed her. They gawked at the space
before them.  Satisfied, Krista walked into the central floor and assended
the stairs towards Rachel.

"Rachel, they cannot resist."  "I suppose we would not do this if they could."
Krista agreed,
	"Yes. And neither they!"
Krista paused and turned her head,
	"Rachel, who is that?"

Krista looked to the figure on the other side of the stairs. He leaned over
the railing and seemed to watch the revelers below.  Rachel answered:
	"I don't know. He was sitting by the window when we last met with
	Lester."
"You're good. I didn't pick that up."  "Yes...he seemed to blend in. He has
that peculiar quality."

Krista tapped the side of her lip.
	"Rachel, please have a chat with him. I would not want any hinderence
	in our plans."

Rachel raised her eye brows, flicked her feet, and walked casually along
the banister.  As she drew near she appraised him. He leaned with one arm
against the banister and seemed to be looking about himself with open eyes.
"He is amused with my creation", Rachel thought and smiled, "Yet, he is
different than the rest. They cannot help themselves and are as good as
the decor. It is what they pay for. To be thinkless and instinctual within
their dreams. But his man is different. He knows where he is and sees what
is unseen. If this hall and it's revelers were a painting, he stands within
observing from without. In times past kings would comission works of art. Now
everyone is their own king or queen. Now they comission me to be made into
art. Yet this man is different. He looks like he has understanding. That
could be dangerous.  What could he want? How did he get here?"


Rachel drew near and the man turned and noticed Rachel. The flash of white
from his eyes pierced her persona and her heart beat.  She shook the thought
and drew a comment of testing.
	"Night lets one dance like no one is watching."
He responded,
	"Then who is there to please?"
She answered,
	"Yourself and those who notice" "But I thought no one was watching"
	"It is as if no one was watching" "Why would that matter?"






~ Kastile bent his head and walked into the tunnel. Orange light glowed along
the walls. His boots skuffed against the dirt floor. His hand raised to the
outside of his long coat then fell back to his side. Nausious. Scoundrel
depravity. Kastile spit.

The tunnel opened to a cavern. Kastile straightened, placed his hands behind
his back, raised his head and looked down accross the cavern.

Blue ether stone illumed the cavern in subdued glow. The farthest reaches
twinkled like the night.

Kastile turned is head and looked down on his ruby ring. It glowed deep red.

A hunched form tottered towards him.

"Eh, master. We have been good digging for you."  

Kastile looked up from his ring.  

"So you say?"  

"Yes'm."  

"Excellent. How much?"  

"Lots, lots, lots."	

The figure's face held still in the shadows. It's eyes flickered colors 
in the dimness:
	Orange, Blue 
	Blue, Orange 
	Black, Black on a blink.  
	Blue, Orange

"Keep up the work."  

"Oh yes'm, yes."

The creature swayed backwards and forwards in anticipation. Kastile rached
into his long coat pocket and pulled out a paper package.

The creature cooed.
	"Yes'm, please."
Kastile eyed the creature in distain.
	"How maleable", he thought.
Then Kastile asked,
	"The stone is in the loading bay, yes?"
It turned anxiously on it's feet.
	"Ohh, yes, sire," it managed.

"Okay."  Kastile let the package fall.

The creature yelped and fell on it's knees. It's sense of time slowed.
The package was tied with twine. Both its hands held the bow ends and pulled. The
loops vanished in themselves and the creature unfolded the package onto
the floor.  In the middle of the paper lay a cloth bag. The creature opened the
cloth bag and reached tt's finger toward the opening. Color seemed to drain into 
the bag's mouth. It's fingers, once illumed by the orange tunnel lights turned black 
and white. It bent it's head closer. While it's back shone blue from the ether stone 
behind it, the orange light fled. It dipped two fingers into the bag and widthdrew 
blackened paste. It's mouth mumbled as it spread the paste over it's eyes.

From the tunnel's overlook Kastile walked into the twilight of the cavern. He
followed a path outlined by ether stone. "How faithful these creatures are,"
he thought, "Even within their anguish they with hope to satisfy their mind.

Xavier sat up and opened his eyes. He observed how the morning light rippled
through the dangling glass tea cups hanging from the awning of the front porch.
He stood up from the couch on which he had dozed and walked towards the railing. 
The blanket covering the couch lay unwrinkled and unmoved. 

The front door of the house opened and Sebastian ran through. His school bag
bobbled on his back as he ran down the walkway towards the school bus. 
Sebastian wore white sneakers whose laces dangled as he ran. One lace from 
his left shoe landed on the concrete and lay still as his right shoe stepped on 
the lace. The left janked forward and Sebastian pivoted forward. His head whipped
the concrete with a thud and his body lay still. Blood began to drain into the grass
while the school bus driver ran towards Sebastian.
