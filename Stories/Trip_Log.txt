To The East


*__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—*

"After a fifth of a day on the road,
We made our way through Sacramento.
Then went East and into the woods,
And along an Emerald River we stood.

We gazed into the depths of the translucent green,
and swam with our spirits, naked and free."

*__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—*

I took a breath and jumped. Cool water engulfed me. 

It was not the first time I swam in a river. But here, there was novelty, 
freedom: Unconstrained in an environment that itself is unconstrained. 
We lived beyond expectation. 

My legs kicked and I rose to the surface. I wiped water out of my eyes and saw 
my three companions Picnic, Schuyler, Akaiah. 
All were at ease in the wilderness. Give Picnic and Sky matches, rope, 
and a knife, and they could make due in the wilderness for days. 
They could trap for food, make shelter, recognize the best land routes. 
I am fortunate to have learned from them. The third companion, 
Akaiah was an Australian Shepard. She would pant and excitedly wag her 
tail-less rump in any moment of potential adventure. 

The water was refreshing: We had driven 5 hours then hiked 2. 

Our trip started in San Luis Obispo, a town on the Central Coast of California. 
The drive took us inland to California’s Central Valley and we drove North 
towards Sacramento. Sacramento is North East of the San Francisco Bay. 
The Bay being 200 miles north of is considered the Central Coast. At Sacramento 
we continued North East into the Tahoe National Forest. We drove into a town 
called Colfax and by luck came upon a trailhead. We unpacked our gear and made 
our way into the forest.

Further down the trail the trees cleared and we were shown a large valley with 
sides as steep as a V. A river flowed it’s way around rocks and bends at the 
bottom of the valley. We decided our goal was to reach the river. 

The path to the river was a steep, narrow strip of earth beaten into form by 
previous feet. I used my right hand for support while I leaned into the siding. 
The path was just enough to keep you from slipping down.  We made it to the 
river. Clear blue green with a glass surface. We laid down our packs and 
prepared to swim.

I stood on the edge of the river. The rocks and pebbles of the river bed were 
within arms reach. Too shallow I thought. I moved up the river. The crunch of 
loose rock under my boots gave way to faint thuds. I stepped onto a rock slab 
that lay across the valley floor. One side of the slab pushed into the steep 
incline of the V and the other extended into the river. It's sides were worn 
smooth. At one spot the river had carved an indentation. The water sank from 
clarity to a deep, opaque, dark green. 

These waters endure. Held in the unwavering motivation that defines the 
natural world.

I took a breath and jumped. 

*__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—*

We made camp of the other side of the river. I spread a tarp over the corse 
sand and laid down my sleeping bag. After setting up our sleeping areas we made 
dinner: Lentils and sardines. This would become a staple. We watched the full 
moon rise. Shallow shadows fell from rocks and trees. Everything was covered in 
a film of white.

Schuyler played soft melodies on his flute. The valley grew still and for some 
moments listened to the notes that floated through the air. Yet even these tones
were droned out by the oncoming night. The river and creatures of the valley 
resounded in an overcoming noise. The presence swept over us and we sank beneath
the waves of concsiousness.

*__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—*


In the morning the sun rose and continued it’s arc across the sky. The walls of
the valley cast encompassing shadows; the sun was not high enough to fill they 
valley with light. 

I rose from my sleeping bag, stretched, and unconsciously wondered how the day 
would unfold. Where would we be in the evening? How would we get there? 
Who would we meet? These thoughts were unconscious because there was no time to 
think: The present was too vivid.

We needed to get across the river. Yesterday evening we tied our pants, boots 
and socks to our packs and waded through hip deep water. This morning we hoped 
to avoid that chore. I laced my boots and walked down the river hoping to find 
an alternative route. Akaiah bounded after me.

I returned without success. So we repeated last evenings actions. Once across we
were in full alert. The cool morning waters shocked us awake. We geared up an 
hiked up the valley.

*__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—*

Picnic left us. Drove back to San Luis Obispo. 

So here we were: Three friends on the doorstep of the Nevada. Nevada lay across 
the Eastern mountains ahead of us. Our goal was Utah. 620 miles. But this we did
not know. Our specific destination in Utah was not known either. That was 
information still to come. 

What we did know was this: 
	1. We had the gear and provisions to be independent for several days. 
	2. There was one high-way, the 80. 

*__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—*


An old fellow in a pickup gave us a ride from the trail head to the freeway. 
We lay down our packs by the freeway on ramp and waited for our first ride. 
20 minutes passed and a young gal, our age, pulled to the side of the on ramp. 
She said was going to Reno. Her name was Bree. We took the ride.

We crammed our packs into the back seat and squeezed our way into the car. 
It was a small vehicle. Typical 4 door sedan with paint starting to flake.

Music drifted though the car and out the windows while we drove. The tones 
swirled upward and dispersed into the air above the pine trees. We went though a
pass in the mountains that divided California from Nevada. We reached the top 
and wound our way though the canyons to the base of the mountains. Drove past 
the ‘Welcome to Nevada’ sign. It seemed to smile and say: 
“Ain’t no turning back now”.

We got into Reno. Typical city. Highway running though it with suburbs spread 
out on each side. Our bodies swayed left as the car veered a right off the 
highway and into the suburbs. Bree needed to visit an acquaintance before she 
could drop us off at a proper spot.
 
Bree pulled up to a house which was shaded by overgrown trees and covered with 
flakey teal paint. Beer cans lined the walkway that led to the steps of the 
front deck. Vines wrapped their way up the balcony posts. More trash on the 
deck. Screen door was ripped and the main door was ajar. Bree pulled the screen 
door aside and stepped into the house. We followed.

Inside was dimly lit. Curtains covering most windows. Stray rays of light passed
though illuminating  patches of the carpet, the disarray on a coffee table and 
the part of a couch. A lump on the couch pulled a blanket further over itself 
trying to get away from the light. The air was stale and tasted damp. I walked 
though this room and into the kitchen. Dirty plates in the sink. Sticky wood 
floor. It smelled like beer. Bree was talking to someone. I followed a hallway 
and found a bathroom. Good thing I only had to stand.

Back in the car Bree took us to the edge of the city. Here was our best chance 
of getting a ride East. She waved, made a U-turn and drove away. After an hour 
we were picked up. 

We looked out of the windows from the back seat of a black diesel pickup truck. 
Our ride was entering a range of hills. These hills were significant because of 
the physical barrier the hills formed between home and the land we were entering. 
Moments earlier we could see California, our home.

Home was where an ‘expected normal’ had been cultivated: A normalization of 
routine, of surroundings, of friendships. All of which is expected to be there 
the next day. 

Home is where one is familiar. Now we we're strangers. On a lower level we had 
begun to realize it; internalize this. The tether between ourselves and the 
‘expected normal’ had been cut. We only had our supplies and wit to sustain and 
guide us. Money would be scarce. I left my cash, identification, and credit card
in Picnic's car. This was realized when he was halfway home to San Luis Obispo.
We only had Schuyler's credit card. It had a $200/month limit. $100 each for 
food and supplies. We felt displaced. Cast adrift on an ocean. 
Small, insignificant, and alone. The gray hills we passed through served to 
reminded us. We reveled in this challenge. We had no hesitation.

The truck began to descend into open lands. We had entered the expanse of 
Northern Nevada.

*__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—*

Long miles traveled into barren lands.
Miles gained from outstretched arms,
We made our camp upon the wind blown sands.

Done we were with oily roads and large semi trucks.
God! Done we were with asphalt and tar.
As we laid upon these wind blown sands,
Dreams of forest, valley, and hill were ours.

*__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—*


We were dropped off at a trucking town called Fernley. 

Schulyer and I took notice our new surroundings. No longer could we see the 
mountain range that represented California and the river we slept by. The lands 
ahead were flat with hill ranges and rock formations dispersed throughout. 
Barren brush land to the north. Dilapidated oil town to the south. The roads 
smelled of diesel and gasoline.

There was a gas station near to where we were dropped off. Oily cargo trucks 
crowded the local gas station. Drivers stepped out of the tall cockpits and onto
the asphalt. Others walked back from the station and clambered back into their 
pods ready to continue their drive. Travelers filled their cars with gas. No one
planned to stay in this town.

Schuyler and I wanted to continue as well. We decided to wait by the on ramp. 
There was a couple more hours of sun and we thought we might get to the next 
town. 

We looked at our map. The progress into Nevada was the width of an index finger.
At this rate of travel it would take weeks to get across the state and into Utah.

A cool wind blew across the land. The wind flapped the brim of my hat and blew 
it’s way between the fabric of my clothes. I tightened my hat’s draw string and 
pulled my shell layer from my pack: We needed something to break the wind. 

We decided to call it a day after an hour of no success. 
…

We walked North under the highway, past light industrial buildings and into the 
open land. This land was sand and brush. We seeked a place out of the wind and 
out of sight. We found a bush rooted on the top of a small sand dune. 
Here we dug into the dune and created dug outs to shelter us from the wind.

As we sat in our dug outs I thought of how this day unfolded. We woke up by the 
river. Watched the sun chase the shadows out of the valley. We met Bree. Saw the
life of her friends. Then found our way to the the oily town of Fernley, Nevada.

I started thinking about the place where Bree dropped us off: The outskirts of 
Reno. That was the real door step. From our location by the freeway  we could 
see the mountains we had crossed in the morning. Somewhere within the folds of 
the mountains water trickles down to form streams which merge into a river. 
Somewhere along the river four companions had cooked a meal, listened to the 
quiet, and slept. And now, we lay in the sand. Huddled behind a bush covered 
sand dune. I had never felt so alive.

East To Lovelock

In the morning I lay in my sleeping bag still processing what had just occurred.
Two days ago I was sleeping in San Luis Obispo. Now we were in the brush lands 
of Northern Nevada. But enough of that. We had things to do.

The sky was overcast and gave the surrounding area a dim feeling. A cool wind 
blew through the area.

We ate had a breakfast of oats and dried fruit. When we finished Schuyler took 
the pan let Akaiah lick the left overs. When she finished her chore he poured 
sand into the pan. Then he rubbed the bottom using the sand to solidify and 
clean any remains. A splash of water and the pan was fit for it’s next use.

Both of us spent time shaking sand from our clothes and sleeping bags. Rolled 
up my sleeping bag, tied it, and strapped it to my pack. Folded my sleep 
clothes and neatly placed them into the pack. Placed our food at the top of the 
pack for easy access.

Akaiah also packed up. In her pack she carried her bowl, two large bags of dog 
food, and her blanket. She was still getting used to the pack and would totter 
back and forth when she walked.

When we were geared up we started walking through the sand and brush back 
Fernley and the freeway. 

After a few minutes of slogging through soft sand we made it to the northern 
outskirts of the town. We walked past greasy looking truck repair bays and 
truck washing stations. These structures were made of thin metal and had tall 
roofs. Dark figures wearing cloth around their faces washed grime off the 
wheels and bodies of trucks with high pressure hoses.

The day differed in disposition from last. Colder. More alone. Raw.
Wind funnled under the freeway overpass where we walked. We steped onto the 
sidewalk and continued past the gas station. We were headed to the Walmart.

We leaned our packs and gear against a yellow claw-grab game machine in the 
foyer of the Walmart. We tied Akaiah to our packs. Schuyler went to buy food 
and I went to replenish our water supply. Walked into the bathroom and washed 
my face. Felt raw. I filled Shuyler's 3 bottles and my water pouch. Our water 
supply could last a day and a half. I walked back to the packs. Schuyler came 
out a few minutes later. He bought 2 packs of rice, 4 cans of sardines, and 
bread. I opened my journal and took note of the amount we spent. $180 for the 
rest of June. Packed away the extra food, water pouch and journal. Then we 
walked to the freeway.

Waited by the on ramp for an hour. Smiled the best we could. Tried to look 
like honest adventurers; in our hearts we were. We were picked up by a pickup 
truck. The driver felt country. He was hauling a dirt bike in the bed of the 
truck. Was leaking oil so we had to be careful where we put our packs. Sat in 
the back seat with Akaiah. Truck cab smelt of oil and chew. The driver reved 
the engine and east we went. 

Let Schuyler do the talking. My mind turned inward and imagined the truck driver
thinking:


*__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—*

"65 down the 80.
Just picked up two stragglers and their dawg.
Asked me where I was headed. I said East, East to Lovelock.

Mah cycle’s leaking oil,
Told the folks to throw their packs as far back as they could.
Was planning’ on ridin’
But now I got these two…So I think tomorrow I should.

Going’ 65 down the 80. Just another day on the road.
Thought I’d pick up some traveling folk…spice up another day
driving’ this big sky road."

*__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—*

He was friendly. The fellow carried a dirt bike in the truck bed. 
We loaded our packs with care not to get them dripped in motor oil. 
I climbed into the rear seat with Akaiah at my feet. We started rolling. 
We driver said he could take us to the next city: Lovelock. I pulled out a 
notebook and passed the time thinking and writing. After thirty minutes we 
pulled into Lovelock. 

We ate lunch on the side of some railroad tracks. I prepared pieces of bread 
and salamie for us. Satisfied, we walked to the freeway. Looking at our map we 
had made little progress towards Utah. Maybe two fingers into the state of 
Nevada. We were dismayed, but held onto a hope that we might catch a 'big fish'.
While waiting we jested about casting out our arms reeling in car rides. 
Dirt-bike in truck-bed man was a small fish; someone just taking us from town 
to town. 

We needed was to cover ground. We needed a big fish. Gracefully, our needs were 
met in abundance. 

*__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—*

We waited and dreamed of where these cars were going. RV's were a distant hope; 
people driving to far places, their minds attent on their destination. What 
notice to these backpackers standing near an on ramp? Merely a passed highway 
sign; distant figures... We hoped for good willed travelers. Ones who traveled 
with complementary spirit. We choose not those we contact, but goodness and 
dark bid the walkways we are destined for. All life shadowed and illumed by 
light: Goodness expressed in the inheritance of substance. Subtantial goodness 
abounds in the will of those between destinations. 

Time passed and Schuyler took nap. He has a sense for sequence; we would have a 
ride before he woke up.

I stood by the highway while Schuyler slept in the field. We had steady hope: 
Hope which persists beyond excitement. How easy to find hope within novelty and
enthusiasm. How different to keep still one's heart from doubt when past the
point of inspiration. 

Cars and trunks flew by for some time. And what else was there to do than to 
stand, arm outstretched, with a smile on your face? One becomes used to their
situation; it becomes hard to imagine beyond the routine. Standing there, it
was hard to imagine time beyond. 

Then, in an instant, time's slowed clock, resumed it's movement forward.
A car had pulled over. I called Schuyler from his sleep. I let him approach
first. We walked with our packs to the small, humble sedan idling just beyond
the Lovelock's Highway 80 eastbound onway ramp. As we approached I was tentative
as to not bring my hopes up for disapointment.

I stood back with Akaiah while Schuyler talked to the driver through an open 
window. Schuyler stepped back and walked towards me. He smiled. 
The driver opened the door and stepped out. He had white hair, was average 
height, a bit round in the middle, and held understanding beneath his friendly
eyes. His first words were: "Hello, I am Duane, a crazy inventor."

*__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—__—*

Duane lived in Wyomming. He was in California for a business conference, 
something to do with designing products for the Chinese. Later we would learn
more about his creations.

At the moment we were amazed by providence. Initially Duane drove past us on the
highway. But he said there was something within him that told him to turn around.
How easy to have let such a though go. So many cars had regarded us as scenery.
Yet, something had moved him to see us. He pulled off the next exit, returned 
the opposite direction, pulled off, and drove onto the Eastbound onway ramp
where Schuyler, Akaiah, and I were waiting. So it happened that  Duane became 
a large the enabler of our trip.

And just as surprising was that as we were driving East down highway 80, 
I was behind the wheel. 



It would turn out this chance
had even more to give. But this we did not know. What we did know was that we i
were set for Salt Lake City, Utah.
