On The Nature of Clouds

I have arrived at the border of Germany and Switzerland. As I write under this
oak, white clouds drift from country to country, free of that national pretense
that plauges the minds of men. 

The cloud, and embodiment of independence, of innocence, of naivity.  What
romantic creatures, who live without a final destination; who live out their
lives in the present moment; for what are these abstrations of past and future
to these citizens of the earth? We run our lives against the pocketwatch. Here,
now there, now back to here, all while thinking how and when we will arrive at
there. How they must laugh!

See, these creatures, bumbling about all day, trying to reach some unknown
goal.  Oh yes, they are quite the experts! Who would not be after doing the
same thing for thousands of years? Why, let us amuse these souls with our
beauty. Have them write ballands about our nature, journal entries, the whole
lot! Let us play their everchanging temperment! Watch as they associate our
thunderous orchestrations with fear. Our loyal and good natured tribute to our
earth, rain, met with declined faces and solemn attitudes. And when we have
nothing to do and laze about with the sun on our backs, they turn their
scrunched faces towards the heavens and bless our majesty. What sporatic little
creatures they are.
