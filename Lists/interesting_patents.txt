Noise cancellation for aerial vehicle(Go-Pro) 
May 29, 2018
Patent #: 9,984,672
Abstract: 

A noise cancellation system for an unmanned aerial vehicle may have
an audio capture module, a metadata module and a filter. The audio capture
module may be configured to receive an audio signal captured from a microphone,
e.g., on a camera. The metadata module may be configured to retrieve noise
information associated with noise generating components operating on the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The filter may be configured to receive the
audio signal and noise information from the audio capture module. The filter
also may be configured to retrieve a baseline profile from a database based on
the noise information. The baseline profile includes noise parameter to filter
out audio frequencies from the audio signal corresponding to the noise
generating component. The filter may generate a filtered audio signal for
output.
