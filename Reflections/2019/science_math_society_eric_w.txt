Why are we waiting be scared of AI?

- What about "Artifical Life"

System of selctive pressures
- Magic ingredients for expressivity
    - Variation
    - Heritability
    - Differential success

- spawn() is a reproductive system?
- Where do we see inanimate life outwitting living life
    - Lower lifeforms are "duping" intelligent targets

- We only need to outwit ourselves
    - Something does not need to know what it does to be dangerous
    - Natural selection will select successful bad traits

- Self modification of code? (logic)?

- Our immune system can adapt to new dangers
    - It is simple, yet general enough

- Talking about AI generates new ideas
- Can we hold back innovation?
    - Perhaps we can proportion the speed of advancement 

Parasitism and Symbiosis
    - A thin line
    - Predators & parasites drive our evolution?

Have we felt where we really are?
    - "It will always be nothing"
    - We don't know how dangerous things can be

What is the great mystery of our time?
    - We have been very stable since nuclear weapons development
    - "We are in video game mode"
    - We think everything will be fine
    - The toys we have are very dangerous

Breaks in the "Program of our Lives"
- Election of Donald Trump
- Fall of Lehman Brothers
- 9/11

Powers that Be
- Part emergent
- Part deliberate

Competing Narratives 
- Globalization
    - Duty, care to global system
- Nationalism
    - Culture, language, duty

Where will the pendulums settle?
Eric does not trust Pinker's optimism

We have moved the kinetic energy of war into
potential energy.
