Perhaps then, these moments reveal a tendency and working of God in this world. 
How we are brought together! 

How free we are to pursue the desire of our minds. What we wish, we are given.
In the darkness the demons grant us experience with burning condition. They
work in a spiritual world; their doings subtle and destructive.

Damned are the hearts that curse. Guilty am I. Yet grace over
all to those who long and who God calls. Within the stillness of my heart I give
thee all. 

And even yet, upon the close of day, when silence overcomes and sweeps away
	the longings;
		joined hands of worldly community,
So I pray: 
	Deliver this soul to the promise made whole in our hearts.
	That through the way of Christ we will find your lovingkindness
	in our lives. Through the days be present my Lord. My God, lead me
	Through the mist and safely along the ragged cliffs of this culture.
	Withdrawn, forlorn, departed, and gone is the mind of the human
	with out thee as Lord. Humble us, I pray to thee and show us our minds
	compared to yours.
