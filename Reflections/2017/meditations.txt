5/7/17 This is God's presence: Flowed upon our senses, The quiet of a restless
heart; Stilled by emotion without time.

5/20/17 And shone a light, Lord a light before our eyes, Lord may your light
always be seen, Lord we want our eyes to be open!

-/-/17 Dear Father, How dear we are in your sign.  We need not prove ourselves;
You are and we are in You.  Through the noise you signal; a beacon in the inner
most place of our hearts.  Dwell in our hearts we pray Father. Let us know,
always: You are Aways, always with us, closer than our souls to ourselves.

We love you.

-/-/17 Lord, We have trained ourselves as dogs to a bell; our minds to the
suggestion of stimulus.

Lord, my God, These impulses take away from patience, from a single mind.

Lord, we are a split people, drawn to whim from whim.  What great love we
miss when our minds are not still; When stillness does not suffice.

Lord, Raise our hearts,
      out intention towards the light of your son.

Dear Father, Plants do not grow by the flashing of light. But they grow as
constant sun passes over the day in the motion of planets. Lord, you endure
beyond planets and stars. Still you dwell in us. Let your word be water,
your presence light, your church the soil in which we grow.

Amen.
