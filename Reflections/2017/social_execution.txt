What a beautiful social execution! Was sitting at a table eating dinner when
an acquaintence approached. We exchanged pleasantries: Remarked on
apprerances and on our gratitude of chance. 

We conversed in proportion to our aquaintence. She sat across from me and we
looked open opon each other. We talked of the future and of hope; quick
things to think about.

Half nervous, I pulled an anecdote into the light. Sometimes it is hard to
know how much an acquaintence cares about the moments in your life. Yet I
was encouraged by her openness and initiation, so I spoke my mind. 

We talked of culture; music, events, of the town. A chat of pleasant
thought.

Then a moment of pause. A queue of continuation.  My friend is well felt and
a queue for me was a queue for her. She got up, returned the chair to it's
place and smiled. We beslot to meet again. Glad you will be around, I said.

So the moment ended;
on a good note ended,
gracefully closed.
