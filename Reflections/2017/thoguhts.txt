I have thought of two beautiful names: Caspian and Vega.

I have through the more I learn, the more I imagine. Yet knowledge is our
downfall. Through it we have conjured the worst. 

I have thought, how young am I.
Through my pride wishes to say:
	"I know myself",
I do not. 

Wisdom intuited is not wisdom acted. Still, in the midst of being, my
impulses for anger, lust, frustration are loosly reigned. My self-constrol
has improved over these years, but it could be better.

I grumble when my work is frustrating. 
I kiss when emotion is hightened between two of attraction.

How easy to walk the path of righteousness while the wind is still and the
path clear. How difficult when the wind blows and the ground shifts.

The Word of the Word is our light, our stability.
In Christ wisdom is simple, innocent.
In Christ love is pure.
