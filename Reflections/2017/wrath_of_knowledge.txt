Behond, our lowly standards for entertainment:

Lost innocence sold for tattoos and alcohol and the 
	wrath of dehydration. 

Lord, how far these men seem from the fold of your promise:
	That on an upcoming day your children
	may return to our true selves; untainted by age, toil;
	forever free from the persecution of worth.

	Streams of living water; your grace, my Lord.

We live within the kingdom of man:
	Build, created by, not the sweat of the devil, but by our 
	own efforts. All that was needed to unleash nature's most destructive
	force was to revel in that fatal knowledge.
