In the light of God grow seeds of tomorrow.

In God is tomorrow.

My faith is sustained by the presence of the Spirit
who watches all,
In whom our hearts find rest.

Weary heart, why ache thee so? What ails thee? Pray, my heart, unfold.

I long and ache for fulfilmet of hope. Some of these my own, and these I lay
aside for they are not mine to control. Still, expectation is there. As if God
withholds; that we may long more for Christ.

Though the storm of morning struggles my "I's" fall to their knees if not
strength led me to dress. 

Splattered, my emotion. My heart open: 

A still pool of water marched through by boots of days and splattered along the 
trail's edge. The effort, my bootsteps, trample quiteude. Information throttled
full: 
	False satisfaction.
	Satisfaction contents, yet our thirst for amusement
		is not quenched by subscribing or publishing.

Amusement. A muse. A fancy of our mind in play with the mind of another.
Depth: That interaction may last; that a moment may prevail through and past
immidiate circumstance; that a push from God will move through all days.
