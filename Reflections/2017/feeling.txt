At least I feel. It lays beyond my grasp to express. But at least, I
feel.

There are moments that steal your heart away to a place where time and space
collect in the bowl of one's mind. If one is emptied of thought, the mind
fills with a mix of impressions from past, present, and perchance future. 

I pray, let these throghts be pure. Let them come from my true self. Let me
not be displaced by throughts not of my self. These true thoughts are a gift
of release. These true throughts granted by ultimate truth of God our
Father, our Lord Jesus Christ and the spirit which fills all in all.

So too, my mind is filled. By the power of the Spirit I am led in intuition
and insight. Gifts of our most gracious Lord. 

Time, space. By these we are bound. Still, my heart knows more. Whispers of
gentle throught swirls gently within the bowl on my mind.
