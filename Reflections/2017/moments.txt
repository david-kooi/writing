Perhaps then, these moments reveal a tendency and working of God in this world. 
How we are brought together! 

How free we are to pursue the desire of our minds. What we wish, we are given.
In the darkness the demons grant us experience with burning condition. They
work in a spiritual world; their doings subtle and destructive.

Damned are the hearts that curse. Guilty am I. Yet grace is over
all to those who long and whom God calls. Within the stillness of my heart I give
you all, my Lord. 


So I pray: 
	Deliver this soul to the promise made whole in our hearts.
	That through the way of Christ we will find your lovingkindness.
	Through the days be present my Lord. My God, lead me
	Through the mist and safely along the ragged cliffs of this culture.
	Withdrawn, forlorn, departed, and gone is the mind of the human
	with out you Lord. Humble us, I pray, show us our minds
	compared to yours.
