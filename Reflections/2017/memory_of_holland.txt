I recall fondly one summer in Holland. It was our last day and we were
flying back to California. Our taxi picked us up early in the morning when
light had still to break. The driver was young, professional.

We drove empty highways through Dutch pastures where cows stood before
modern windmills and small towns open unto the sky. 

Wat en Nederlanse ochtend! The sun rose orange amoungst distant clouds and
lit all we saw in morning clarity. Orange this day-break as Oranje her
colors. 

What a farewell offered by this beautiful land! A morning enduring; full in
each moment. Each second seemed everlasting; itself gratified in it's own
instant of color and scene. Distinct, these notes of pasture, roadway, and
color. Wrapped together, secured by the family I love.  

Distinct these note:
	Togeter a Dutch anthem of sophistic, smooth,  electronic music played in
complement to the all we saw. Our young driver knew his countries treasures.
