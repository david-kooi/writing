Thoughts Before a Trip

(June 2014)

It was not until last night that I felt the significance of what this summer is 
going to be. 

My focal point has been so small. All that I have been able to see has been myself. 

Last night I broke through that barrier. I went to Picnic’s. Schuyler has 
established an elegant and functional shelter under a tree. A gate opens to a 
dirt driveway. When closed the gate acts as one of the walls. A white wood fence
runs perpendicular to the gate. This forms another wall. Opposite to this is a 
row of trees. Between the trees and the white fence is Picnic’s Bronco. Schuyler
has set it up as a cozy room for sleeping and storage. My friend has done well 
for himself. 

We talked more about the trip. What to expect…what to bring…etc. 

I am going to start getting ready when I get back from LA.
