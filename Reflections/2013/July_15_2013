Cannot sleep. To many throughts flying through my head. 

Times are changing. Almost done with life at Mustang.  A reminder that most
things are temporary. What do I feel?  Heh...not sure. I guess this is the calm
before the storm.  And it is in this calm that I should prepare myself for the
transistion.

This place is going to be crazy. In all meaning of the word.  I met Pete today.
The man who is offering his house to me and several people. Greay guy, but I
get the feeling that he is being plauged by baggage from roomate circumstances
that did not live up to expectations. The majority of what we talked about was
the stuff others did and how we should learn to avoid it. Avoid by being up
front with everything. Which is something new to me, yes, but an area I
recognize needs growth.

Consistency. I will have to be consistent with me, my work, and my attitude.
Must be there 100% of the time. Going to have to pull myself towards some
higher standard of life in which life is the house, school, and my work.

Yes, it will be tough. No, I do not know the full implicatinos of it all.

My life is going to be rocked.
