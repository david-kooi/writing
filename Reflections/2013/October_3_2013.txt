Thursday Morning, Cuesta Grade

Cynicism. Cynicism is the mental disposition someone reaches when they
associate their burden with the disfunctionality apparent in the world. 

Optimism. Optimism is the mental disposition of someone who associates their
hopes and achievements with the functionallity apparent in the world.

As with many things, there is proper balance between the two. I think it is
important to be aware of one's own mental disposition. Different situations
call for different viewpoints. And even in those situations one must be
dynamic. 

I drove with Trent to his family's house in the Modesto backcountry.  I am
really starting to fall in love with the country. With the open air, roaming
animals, independent people.  Not sure if that is where I want to go. Perhaps
later in life. Trent's dad, Chuck, works for the fire department.  Trent's mom
teaches. Well, we went to a bike rance and spent two days and one night in
China Peak. We had to transfer our camp into the China Peak hotel because of
heavy rain. Absolutly wonderful weekend.

Then I had a week of class, worked the weekend, and that brings me here.  Ready
to bomb down the grade.
