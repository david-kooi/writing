And another day finished. Time is such an elusive thing. But I have not opened
this notebook for the sake of idle pondering.

Structure. Intellectual dicipline. They must be formed and maintained.

Ah...but yes, I fail to include something. The real reason i started writing.
Spiritual dicipline.  Yes. 

I helt convicted about how I conducted my mental transition from my bible
strudy to my room here in mustang. 

It is rather insincere how I went from a study of the Bible to my own life.
From acceptance to disregard. Well, I must look to amend this dicotomy.

Should I feel guilt because I am writing about God in this notebook?  Shuold I
feel guilty about my own character?

Lord, you know my heart. You know what I struggle with.  The constant search
for truth. I try to be wise for my age, but the I realize I am young, with
little experiance. Guide me if you will, along your path, for I know you have
grace in store for me.
