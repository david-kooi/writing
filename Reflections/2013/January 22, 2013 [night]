7:58 PM

First day of class.

Trig is straight forward, nothing that will be to challenging.

The thing I need to work on the most is my time management.

Speaking of that, I have finished my Trig hw till next class, and have read
the beginning of my Anthro book.

I am going to take a little break and then head over to Jon's to hang out.

Okay, it is pretty obvious, I struggle with lust. Every good
looking girl I see I in some way fantasize about. The only reason I
am writting this is because it shows me, and anyone else who
ends up reading this, that such an attitude is not activly put forward into 
my head. It really just sneaks it's way into my thought space.

The rush is so satisfying though...

More on this later.
