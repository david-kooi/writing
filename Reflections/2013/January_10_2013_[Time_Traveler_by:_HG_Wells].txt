Another wonderful solitary day during my winter break.

I am refreshed by this new wave of thought that has been so lacking in my
last couple months in San Luis Obispo.

I just finished the Time Traveler by H.G Wells. This is a book that I plan
read to my children when that phase in life comes to pass.

But yes, a wonderful story about the Time Traveler and his adventure into the
far future. In the book's reality line, humanity reached the pinnicle of social
balance. The workers were content with their work, and needed no more. The
upper class [literaly] too had every resource that they needed to thrive.

The ideal world in H.G Well's book is one of class acceptence. One where
social classes lose sight of their possible advancement, and simply take
their place in the natural order of things.

Yep natural darwinism at it's finest.

Except Wells hints at the impossibility of a static society in which one
ideal is realized.

The perfect social order slowly meets the problem of "perfect sustainability
" ... something only nature can achieve and something  that seems impossible
 with non natural means of design.

Which brings up a question from before I left to San Luis Obispo: Is human
society unnatural?

I came to the conclusion that it was not. So perhaps I should rephrase my
above statement.

*-* The pefect social order slowly meets the problem of "perfect
sustainability" which is something only nature can achieve and something
that seems impossible with non-natural regulation.  *-*


The edit I have commited to that statement lies in the diffrence between
artificial design and artificial regulation.
