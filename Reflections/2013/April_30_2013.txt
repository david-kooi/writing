The Next Day

I am trying to maintain continuity with my previous entries.

I am on the bus towards Cuesta. I was half certain I would miss the bus today.

The morning is painted with a cool gray. The fog from the sea lingers for the
main part of morning.

Meanwhile everyone abord this existential transport maintains the proper silent
civility which is an unspoken requirement during most of life's mundance
occurances. It is a line that waits to be trespassed by someone free.  I am
working towards that point.

1:24PM

A few minutes before my next class. I thought I'd write a few reflections on
the last segment of Cloud Atlas. Adam Ewing's experiance of a "converted"
island in the pacific. The scene is set in a dinning hall and the conversation
has steered to the topic of aryan supremacy. The great mysteris is thus: Why is
the white man on top of the civilized ladder?
