Oh cursed introspection. What must I be so weighed down by events and relations
outside of my own? Why do I feel somewhat obliged to address certain issues
just because I choose not to appeal to false ignorance any longer?

Last night, while in the shallows of my sleep, I was awoken by Eddie, my
roomate, and Paige, his girlfriend, bickering in the still hours of night. I
have dealt with such occrances before, but last night my peace broke.  No
surprise either, who would not after having to see the muddled and decrepid
hearts of those two souls day after day after day. 

The bickering in itself is not so bad. Well, it is.  Hearing the constant
sneers quickly invades the mind with perpetual gloom. Yes it is bad. The worst
is seeing the two dawn great masks of civility. Masks of false countentment.
While silently knowing what their true faces are. 

To see dark where others see light. To see through the cracks and see that
brooding monster. To know that it is not cynisism what provides your thoughts
about two individuals, but plain depressing truth. To know this, and yet be
helpless to it's remedy. 

It sucks.
