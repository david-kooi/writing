Had to take a break to reflect on the new developments that are coming to pass.
First and foremost, the app is making progess.

We had a brief presentation in class. I need to work on my sales pitch. My talk
was scattered and all over the place. But progress, yes.

Talked to Belinda today. In my mind I expected her and I to have a brief, brief
talk, but she seemed to linger. Now I am debating on asking her out for coffee. 

But upon present thought something like that seems scripted. As if that is what
is expected of me. No, I'll take this my own way. An evening walk should
suffice.

But when is the question. When?  Tonight. Before that fleeting fire blows out.
