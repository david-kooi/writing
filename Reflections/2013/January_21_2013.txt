I just got back to Mustang tonight.

Spent the last couple hours settling back in. Not sure if my mind is settled
though, but I'll see when the common sense of the morning comes by.

Definatly diffrent athmosphere than what I experiance back home.  Shows how
much setting makes a diffrence in the way persons experience life.

I feel motivated and energized to start up work again. Tomorrow I will
write myself a letter from my future self in an attempt to find a source of
continuous motivation.

Also need to write Anna. Yes, this is a must. But I think I'll take a day
or two to get my thoughts together.

My mental state is so diffrent this place of independence and freedom.
It sounds so cliche to say that though. Hmm...I wonder if I could word
that better...

Some more things to think about.

I do not start work at Shell till this weekend. But I will give Raffe a call
in the next couple of days.

To Do: Contact lens solution Food shopping &c.
