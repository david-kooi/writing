How to further develop my writing? I can see how riting more often would
increase my written eloquency, but I sense that there needs to be strcture
behind my methods.

I must not continue sporatically writing about the same recuring postulations
of time, purpose, love, etc...  Naturally, each of those elements are broad
topics, but my focus has been on single streets rather than whole cities. 

An explorer does not explor by revisiting past monuments over and over again.
That is what one calls a tourist. But even as there is room to cultivate an
explorative method, it also needs to be acknowledged that one must be a native. 

Yes, a balance between the explorer and the native.  Such an idea can be
applied to both micro and macro occurances within existance.

Potential short story: A comparative between the POV of an explorer and native.
