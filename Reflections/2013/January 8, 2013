I just got back from Chantry. Needed to out run my thoughts for a little. 
And so right now I think I'm going to let them catch up so I can record and 
be done with these lingering whisps of ideas.

So I watched Django Unchained last night. Found it very disturbing. The plot 
was well thought out. But it dealt with heavy non ethical concepts...like the 
delusional mistreatment of the blacks during the US's earlier part of
 existence. 

I am not sure what message Quentin Tarantino was trying to send here. 

In a movie like Cloud Atlas, the depiction of inhumanity directly contributes 
to the films plot and message. But in Django, the brutality seemed to be 
meaningless; just a sideline extra. 

Yea. 

Then I took Syrena home. 
It was nice to have someone to momentarily care for and to be the center
of attention to. But now I understand why Jamie does not want to pursue
his relationship with Mel, it takes so much mental effort. 

And similarily, last night and this morning I was entranced by wild lust.
It was a good experiance...I now know that hookups and relationships are
overhyped. Unless you find someone who really brings out the best in you.

And I am just waiting for that.

I think that that is all that there needs to be said. 

dk.
