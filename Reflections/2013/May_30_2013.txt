The greatest personal epochs end and begin without the slightest bit of cosmic
grandure.

One can easily pass by such moments without so much as a second though, just as
we all so often stride by examples of potential thought and beauty.  And what
of these moments?

So rarely is the mind's vision clear apart from time between major change.
Even minor change for that matter. I have so often been fragmented, apart from
the greater reality of things. The world becomes reduced to my own limits, and
all that is out of bounds cannot be reached. 

This is the mind of the hard working student.  Obviously this "existential
fragmentation" comes in different forms and circumstances.  Indeed coping with
this is entirely up to the individual. 

From this, it can be easily seen how good friendships arise. They arise from
common ways to address common mental states.

I think that mental health in this day and age is underated. 

But yes, I jsut lost my thought.

Well, right now really is a transition period. My first year of college is
done.  And what can I say about it?

- The personal and visionary progress I made the past two semesters is phenomenal.
- I haveprepared myself for higher level science
- I have found the lifestyle I want to live and 
  the type of people I want to surround myself with

It sure is curious. I still do not comprehend the amazing developments that
have happened.  Well, I have some coding to do, but after that I am free. 

Well, free for right now.
