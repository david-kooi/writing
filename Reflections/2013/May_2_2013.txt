Didn't do it.  Was disappointed, but I think there still might be a chance to
salvage this.

Had the first session at SloOps, the rock climbing gym. It will be nice to see
the progress. The mental shift before and after the gym was a curious thing.
As if there was a definite transformation.

Oh, who am I kidding. I want to write like Frobisher and Keyserling, but I
stand at the foothills of giants. 

I suppose the best thing is to keep at it.
