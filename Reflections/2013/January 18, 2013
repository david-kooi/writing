First TED talk today.

I drove to Caltech around 8 in the morning. Honestly I had no idea what
to expect. After getting my pass and bag, I began the wait to enter the
Ramo auditorium. I met Kirk, a scientist at JPL and we talked a little.
Naturally we drifted into the world of space and physics.

Yea so we settled down inside of the auditorium. The show was to be projected
live onto a projector screen.

A couple minutes before the event began, I saw a fimiliar face. It was my
old and still good friend Jackson! I retired for Kirk's company and joined
Jackson and his brother Corey.

What a perfect stroke of luck! A friend that I have wanted to catch up with
and full day to do it!

After the first session we had lunch and talked some more. He is going to
be pursuing an internship at Caltech. Still cant explain through text how
good it felt to be in companionship together. It felt as if all the time we
had spend apart living diffrent lives did not matter and our precence with
each other was completly natural. (:
