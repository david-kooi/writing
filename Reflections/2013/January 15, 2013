Life is really starting to spiral down into automation. To be honest, I'll
be glad to go back to a productive meaningful life next week.

That is not to say that my experiances here negative. Quite the contrary.
But it is my consistent routine of waking up later, bumming around, and
eventually retiring in my customary chair that is causing me to be neglegent
of my existence.

An example?

Well imagine being the CEO of a very well off company.  The past quarters
have gone well so you decide to give yourself a month off.  In this month
you plan to review the numbers...and catch up on some self time.

Great.

Problem is that as the weeks go by you lose track of where th company is
going and thus lose track of the reasons why you are reading.

Such is the state which I am in.  And it is frustrating.

I have luled myself into a waking trance in which I do not percieve the
possibility of future. Life is creature  contained within the moment, not
allowed to venture beyond.

I have lost track of the adjacent possible. Such a shame.
