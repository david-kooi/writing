Today marks the end of my second semester here at Cuesta.  I scarecly know what
to say.

Yesterday I finished Trig. I can't help but feel a level of excitement because
the higher levels of math and science are open. It will be hard, that I know,
but is not a heart like mine ment for such challenges?

I am inclined to think that is is those challenges that form the person. How
one approaches, lives with, and finishes a challege shape disposition and
chracter. Indeed any mental or physical exertion creates a platform on which a
person can reach up.  Reach up and continue climbing. To where you ask? 

I am not sure, but perhaps future revelation will show me.  What I know is
this: True independence is something few people achieve. 

Either way, today I am presenting my app, Capture, to an audiance who an
comprehend it's technicalities and potential. Today is the completion of an
extended effort.  It is exciting to see the birth of a project. The only people
who can truly understand the profound implications of such a project are those
who have undertaken and started creating their own vision out of their own
initiative.
