So this was originally posted in /r/politics and to be quite frank, I hated
the responses it received. I think /r/philosophy could do a better job of
deconstructing the implications of this proposed city and whether or not it
would succeed.

My thoughts:  I would expect that if such a city was built, the first
residents would be ardent believers in Rand's philosophy. It is pretty clear
to me that if the residents of the city were committed to following Rand's
intellectual based objectivism AND if society were to be founded on the
ideals of individual productivity...such a society would be driven by the
intellectual collaboration of it's residents.

It would thus seem to me that a society with such a high standard for
intelectual contribution would be able to solve their own problems in an
effective manner. Therefore I think that this city would be a plausible
idea...because of it's smaller size, and closer proximity of it's
residents. Something we dont get in a large country like the U.S

At least...that is the ideal Glen Beck is trying to achieve.

Either way I think this would be a Fascinating social experiment.
