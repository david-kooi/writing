I cannot sleep. 

And yet I do not think. I am restless. But for what?  For the inevitability of
dawn? Of perhaps I fear I may never be the person of my dreams.

The former statement seems laden with depth, but it is really something of a
practical matter. I wonder if I will ever gain a clear and sharp mentality
again. My wit has dulled. Worn blut through the everturning grindstone. 

I need to just be. 

My mind has grown dull. Ground at an off angle.  I try to write fluidly, but to
no avail.  What can jostle me from this strange bout?

Oh and what of lost beauty, 
A faded sense that created a faded rose.  
Where one clear sky reigned, 
Was dethroned by this frettful haze.
This fruitful life.
