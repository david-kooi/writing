I like to think I'm different.
That motivation and personal action exempts me 
from the culture of consumer totality.

I want to minimize my contribution to the existence of
unnessecary firms.

I bike, eat simply, and try to support the local shops.

And here I am. In a fucking starbucks. The distasteful pop music has become 
white noise. The countertop, menu board, and pastry case gleam with corporate tack. 
Little signs display carefully crafted psycological messages telling the patrons
that the amount you buy is related to your personal value. 

Through the door behind the front area is a glaring white stainless steel space.
A perfect representation of what the corporation represents. A sleek public prescense
that tries to be hip and personable with a clean sterile backend. The backend represents the 
means to the end. Offer a useless service for people working useless jobs.
