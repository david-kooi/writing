To: You

To know of your mind and heart is to see Heaven.

Our ideals spurn chance driven occasions: 
	Because then our reasons created in on high.

I have sinned.
In response: Remorse.
	To seperate myself from the will of God
	in pursuit of the thrill of the world. Yet this is past.
		Still, I cannot make exceptions.
	Yet, it is easy to fluster while keeping still in sadness.

To know your beautiful soul is to remind me of the kindness 
and creativity possible to humanity.

Here in Santa Cruz I've met, both emotions.
In various degrees and assortments: So many men and women;
We strive to be our true selves.
Yet ideals are a fixture of mind not in our hands to sculpt.

Our drives of action sculpt and form their mediums.
What power to consider!

How boundless the creation of our hands.
Surely, we are made in the image of our Creator! 
How perfect are sunset colors.
How magnificent the sky's expanse:
	To glow blue in day and to reveal the heavens at night.
What harmony in the steps of time;
    The melodies of music.

These underpinning are beyond comprehension.
Still we strive for expression: To bring the ideals 
of mind and heart into the world; these reflections of God.
