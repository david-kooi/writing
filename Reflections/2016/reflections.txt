To know of one's mind and heart is to see Heaven.

Then, to know ideals spurn chance driven occasions: 
	Our reasons created in high 

In response: Remorse.
	To seperate myself from the will of God
	in pursuit of the thrill of the world. Yet this is past.
		Still, I cannot make exceptions.
	Yet, it is easy to fluster while keeping still in occupation.

And to know your beautiful soul is to remind me of the kindness 
and creativity possible to humanity.

Here in Santa Cruz I've met, both emotions.
In various degrees and assortments: So many darling men and women.
We strive to be our true selves.
Yet ideals are a fixture of mind not in our hands to sculpt.

Our drives of action sculpt and form their mediums.
What power to consider!

How boundless the creation of our hands.
Surely, we are made in the image of our Creator! 
How perfect tare sunset colors.
How magnificent the sky's expanse:
	To glow blue in day and to reveal the heavens at night.
What harmony in the steps of time.

These underpinning are beyond our comprehension.
And still we strive for expression: To bring the ideals 
of mind and heart into the world; these reflections of God.
