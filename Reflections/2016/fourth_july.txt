What a scene!

Children runble rousing, Blankets out spread whereon chairs sit and host
the parents of screaming kids.

An announcer speaks over all people as a wave over the sea floor.  The sun
sets dancing with old time music. It is the only one who dances.

But perhaps, here, the dance is made in the stumbles of people moving between
each other.

I am not in the mood to dance. I feel unwanted; unappreciated.  Silly
thoughts. How I wish for someone to ask me for coffee. How I wish to talk
to someone.

Another reason I don't want to dance is because I might run into people I know.
Then I'll smile and pretend to be happy.
