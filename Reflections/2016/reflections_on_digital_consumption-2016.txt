2016

And yet I am worried about the effect of high quantity, low quality information/entertainment that children look at many hours of the day. 

We live within an Information Revolution that is not 20 years old. So it is difficult to make truth claims about these things.

Personally, I am frustrated by my own information addiction and am trying earnestly to ween myself off pictures and quick bits. The natural world is too impressive and vast to be captivated by continuous digital entertainment. We miss out on subtleties and interpersonal queues when we stare at our phones on the bus.

Anecdotally, I feel that most of my peers (millenials) have low attention spans. I find myself needing to be excessively patient with people because they talk too fast and switch topics instead of developing conversation. I experience this less with non-digital natives.

That said, communities have emerged on the web and have given a place for people to express and develop themselves. Our mobile super computers have allowed us to capture important moments and we are now more aware of the troubles in our world.
