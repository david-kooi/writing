5:40 Adam talks about how generations can't be discreetly defined. I agree, but still think the concept of "technological natives" holds water; Meaning people who grew up as web users. 

11:13 I also agree with Adam that  personal traits are apparent through history. Correct that social media is just media, but the difference in our time, I think, are the light-speed mediums to express and affirm these traits. 

Adam also talks about how generational stereotypes are demeaning. Claiming that 'entitlement' and 'narcissism' are effects of 'bad parenting' is likely unfounded. 

But I think Simon talks more about concerns than stereotypes. Simon and I have a concern for the psychological effect of instant dopamine. 

The psychological effect Simon talks about at 4:30 is curious.
Entertainment triggers dopamine. Around 2007(First iPhone) kids began growing up with personal access to dopamine triggers. What effect that will have? Well, we don't now, 2007 is not that long ago! 

This is, of course, not to downplay the gift of connection. I think most people are responsible users. The internet has enabled amazing avenues of connection and education!

But I do believe there is a portion of kids and adults who are adversely affected by information addition. (Of which I include myself.)
