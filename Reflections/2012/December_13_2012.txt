Its tuesday. One day till the math final. Im feeling pretty good about it.
Today will be a day to solidify what I know.

I've been pretty lazy outside of the libary. Thinking about what I could
do to make my time more productive. I think more reading. Yea. Reading and
working on my code.

Keep thinking that biotech will be a goo field to go into. That or quantum
computer research. Still not sure.

Well off to get dressed and to the library.

Lets learn.
