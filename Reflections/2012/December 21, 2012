It is friday, the first day after my first semester in college. There are two 
feelings that prevade my life. One is that of experiance, knowing that
I have completed the first semester of my significant life. The second is that
of nievity. However you spell that...  I have met so many who's character's
 and intuition's have been formed by the hands of experiance. Men say that 
justice is blind, but I think that can be truely said about the consequences
of our daily choices and actions. 

Im excited to continue this path. I am satisfied. 

I also just finished the [insert adj] Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde.
Think that I will give this book to my children once they begin to see
 the materialistic-sensualistic side of life the media s often offers as
a purpose. [Spoiler Alert] Dorian trades his soul for the superficial 
apperiance of youth and beauty. A painting done of him now bears the burden
of his soul. In the end his painting is mangled and tragic, a true 
representation of what his soul has become. Dorian grows tired of his 
youth and vows to destroy the painting. Stabbing the painting, he kills his
soul. And the circle is completed with his own face bearing the actions of
his soul, and the painting glimmering in the beauty of his past youth.
