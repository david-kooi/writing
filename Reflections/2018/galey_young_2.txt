Writing and Reflections from Galey and Young on English Poetry
8/31/18

Our senses are raw: Recieving color, touch, aroma, melody.
There is no meaning on raw sense. To attach meaning is to perceive:
Senses are passive. 

Perception is to: Grasp thoughroughly and hold as one the raw materials of sensation.
In a word: Perception is to associate.

One question: Can one percieve beauty without association? 

A conjecture: To percieve one associates, therefore beauty cannot be 
percieved without association. To associate is to remember, consciously or not. And memory
is past perception. Beauty cannot be perceived without memory and therefore beauty must be 
associated.

(I know this is a lously non-sequitur argument, but the spirit and consideration of 
objective beauty remains. ) -dk 1/12/18
