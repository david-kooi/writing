Alchoholic joivalty and it's consequences have been replaced by situational
exstacy.

no point to look for it, as like style worn without effort,
because the elements are complimentary and meld the subject into unity.

~ The bus river plugged a groovy tune and we drove on a rainbow of funk.

~ Rain pittered constant against the swings of Vivaldi; Sometimes quiet,
sometimes violent, Violins lifted this car, parked, into a storm of frenzy.
