There is much to explore. Opening a map one imagines the roads, routes,
unknown forests and hidden nooks. What wonder! How grateful I am to live in
this time and place and have resources available to lift one into adventure.

But adventure is not the source of life. To think so would be idolatry. What
adventure reveals is not unique in itself; rather an expression of
discovery, an image of love: That we may be moved to wonder and imagine; And
what an expression of love!  

That to us may be granted articulation and conscience intent. So when we act
on our motivation and proceed into the unknown, looking for gems emergent,
what gratitude that we may remember and partake in this harvest of creation!
