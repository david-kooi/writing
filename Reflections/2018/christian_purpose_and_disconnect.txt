The purpose of a Christian is to grow in in reconnection with God and to
usher individuals to God. Only through reconncetion can we be brough back to
the original intention that is peace on Earth.

Yet I wonder: What does diconnection look like for a person driven in love
and compassion, but un-believing in the Creator revealved by Jesus Christ
and un-receiving of the redemption offered by Christ alone?

By Christ alone are we saved...

Saved from what? From eternal disconnection from God?
From ourselves? 

In dreams I have imagined the dungeons of confinement and depravity that
exist apart from God's light.

What world would that be? One apart from God's light in nature and
God's light in people?

And what world would that be, the on basking fully in God's light;
Where His light eminates unhindered in nature and within our spirit?
