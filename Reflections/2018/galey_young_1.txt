Writing and Reflections from Galey and Young on English Poetry
2/4/18

"Nature waits for her interpreter: For the loving and skillful hand that shall
brush aside the dust of accidentals under which her true self lies; she awaits
the magician who shall touch her when she means most, -arrest her so that for
all time she shall remain with us; most beautiful, most affecting, most
significant."

(What a fantastic piece. "The dust of accidentals"! A phrase easy to hold in
one's mind, but harder to tie down an example of the intuition.) -dk 1/12/18
