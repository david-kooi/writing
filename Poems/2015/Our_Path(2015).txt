Our Path

Oh adventure.

	The feeling of dis-attach-ment,
		The spirit of engagement,

A consistency of mind and body.
		that cannot be emulated

/|\  ————V  within voluntary boundaries V—— /|\	We
give ourselves walls,			     /|\ /|\		 for
the sake of the future:		    /|\ /|\	Morning alarm clocks,
/|\ /|\		    class schedules…			    /|\ /|\
/|\  With the occasional festival!  /|\ But then back to the forbidding
mornings    /|\ /|\	and anxious nights.				/|\
/|\	   And anxious nights lead to		/|\ /|\
/|\ /|\————V	    Clear mornings!   V——————  /|\
/|\	       /\			       /\			/|\ /|\
/|\ /|\ …but morning bliss fades like fog to hot day.     /|\ /|\
/|\ /|\  And so the days and nights go by….		    /|\ /|\
/|\ /|\————V	    Until the walls are broken	    V——-/|\
	       /\					   /\

and the skies re open
		 Green hills resound their color to the clouds,
			while the blue of the sky floods the land of night,
	And all becomes as clear as day.

Open minds,
	Clear hearts,
Simple Desires.
