Spilled Tea 2015

Quiet gloom drips a flurry of sprinkled mist accross the windows.

Kissed were lips on the mug's brim, Warmth held within two hands, As if home
were hands and the mug were I.

Aroma filled the nose, I raised to drink, this I enjoy...

But then the tea, the boiling flavor water,
	burnt my tounge: for weeks numb,
			then spilled all over me.
