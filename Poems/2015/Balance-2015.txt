Signal and noise,
Balance and Poise,
Maintenance and dysfunction.

A few words to describe,
The ongoing life,
That endlessly flashes before our eyes.

Of hope and effort.
Two concepts intertwined
	And must remain balanced within the mind.

Unguided effort creates entanglement:
	Obscurity distanced from original intent.

And hope without effort,
	Creates white cloud whisps that pass,
		through fingers when you reach out touch them.

So guide your efforts with clear intent.
Find balance, find flow.
Keep momen-tem.
