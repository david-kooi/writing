Dawn light ignites the ocean
	into waves of flame,
A sailor 

Church is a mechanism that holds together,
For people are frightened and confused,
Church is a symbol of sanctuary, shelter for the abused.

Poetry church?
A sanctuary for those who see
	majesty within the shadows of the world.
A sanctuary for those who see
	disparity and pain within the highlights of this Earth.
We must be free from hate, free from assumption, free from fear of 
	being judged. We must run naked along the brook lest we be unblessed.

We must be naked from presumption, naked in the eyes of Earth.
Humble because we know so little. 
Humble because our world is an atom of the Universe.

To the Christian, or Muslim, or Jew who comes accross this fb page of poetry church,
The message is clear: "FUCK YOU."

"Fuck your religion, for it has caused pain."
"Fuck your beliefs, for they are not mine."
"Yes, yes, fuck your higher power."

At least this is what I see.

Lust for power, lust for love,
Human nature's base tendencies,
These are what corrupt. 

God is all, god is one,
God is love, creator of all and none.

The abusers, torturers, dominators have not seen 
	the face of their father.

The killers, enslavers, colonizers, are not of god.
The maniupulators and TV evangelicals are not of substance.

Do not generalize hate against the followers of religous church.

Because what is wrong with religious church is a reflection of 
destructive tendencies in all of us. 







So what then?
Is there only one path to truth?
Yes. Through the eye of the needle.
After that it's up to you. 








It is not the church we are against.
Let us not make the church a scapegoat. 

Why do we marginalize those who seek truth?
Why do we demonize those who are confused?
Are we not all?
