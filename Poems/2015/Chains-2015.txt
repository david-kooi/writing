Bought into the system…again.

It happens everyday with the exchange
	Of an abstraction pressed into paper:
		Dollar bills printed with the ink of capital imperialism.

The foundations of our modern system are hidden from sight:
	Dark fume spewing trucks connecting animal holocaust
		with trendy restaurants.
	Animals in chains to the supply chains, 
		both spew gas into the eco chain.
	
	Blinded to ecological pain,
	Created for corporate gain.

	And from our eyes chains,
	Attached to the the screens of our phones.

	Let your hand go 
		And knees will buckle…head will tumble,
			Pulled down by from your phone falling to floor.
	All to worship an ego that always wants more.
