To Summer
2015

My dear, how do I ask you out?
Coffee or beer? What is your style?
Maybe sit on the beach awhile
	and watch waves roll in and sky change hue,
		from blue to orange-red.

Would you go out with me?
To the sea, rocks, and unknown spots
	To find places to fit each other 
		within our lives?

Oh, the night weighs on my eyes,
And I hope next morning to be free of you.
