Clouds fill two valleys.

Like water;
	Fog like water defies gravity and flows up mountain slopes,
	Rounds mountain tops and flows down through gullies,
		And dissipates into clear air.

Clouds all around.
Mountain tops rise above a sea of white,
Basking in the warmth of the sunâ€™s light.
White spreads to the horizon.

Love abounds!
And beauty too.

White waves,
And peaceful views.

The sun follows an arc across the sky,
Lighting the ocean for a while.

The day moves on, things to do, stuff to be done.
So I descend into the sea. Focused. 
My mind trained to ignore triviality.
