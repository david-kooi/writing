I am frustrated. I long for intimacy. None outside my hands is available. The
bars are hopeless. People do not go to them to meet others.  At least that is
my experience. You talk to strangers and they stay strangers. You dance. And
you dance by yourself. Perhaps it is this town. Perhaps it is myself. I find
a complete lack of romantic interest in this area. What do women want?

I wish to be inspired by someone. I wish to inspire someone. Reciprocation,
is that not equality?  To burn with passion uncontained, to feed off each
other's flame. I hope to synchonize with a beautiful spirit. To dance within
the chaos of the universe. Let the world spin around us!

Sure, I can dance by myself. I can feel awe, elation, passion by myself. But
how much more powerful if two complimentary pieces are joined?

Oh muse.

I am so discouraged. And I find it pathetic.  But the feelings are real. They
cannot be hidden.

Perhaps it is myself. Perhaps this I am making mountains out of hills.
