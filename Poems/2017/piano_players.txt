Piano players are flowers in this world of concrete and steel;
Sanitized rooms are given fragrence throught to be lost under 

the sweeps and
bleach and
sequence of circles and
sweeps and
bleach and
sequence of days,
again a Monday and
a weekend and
sweeps and bleach and
sweeps and bleach on Tuesday
and Sunday again to start again.

But what impresses on my ear?
A memory once felt. In our culture we think:
"Had we not bought one before?
"Perhaps we need to buy it again."

Bought a memory?
Sure, that is how most things are sold. 

~

Does it not float these notes, graced?
Above the tables and chairs and people;
Like a breeze through a stuffy attic:
In one window, past the chests, swirled about
whisping dust from their still and timely rest.


Then down the stairs, and out another door,
and joined again with the sun and clouds,
    returned to where it was before.

---

It is too like sunlight, this music.
Like sunlight that drifts down to pierce our hearts.
