Piano players are flowers in this world of concrete and steel;
Sanitized rooms are given tragrence throught to be lost under 

the sweeps and
bleach and
sequence of circles and
sweeps and
bleach and
sequence of days,
again a Monday and
a weekend and
sweeps and bleach...

But what impresses on my ear?
A memory once felt. Had I not bought one?
Bought a memory? Perhaps we need to buy it again.

~

Does it not float, these notes?
Above the tables and chairs and people;
A breeze through a stuffy attic this is.
In one window, down the stairs, and out another
and joined again with the sun and clouds.

It is too like sunlight, this music.
Like sunlight drift down to pierce our hearts.
