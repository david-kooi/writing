8/3/17

Sweet music that comes from afar,
Over the building by the winds are taken,
And reach mine ear on a distant patio,
Make me wish for closer relations.

How sad, I thought, of missed experiance,
Those notes so well my heart could use,
Yet here sits I on a distant patio,
The music hinted to my soul refused. 

But a hint is enough to know it exists,
And my heart rendered well to know there are notes,
For the wind to carry and not be colored in vain,
And I pray for pure love for the one who is close.

Though I may not be near and never might be,
I am glad such exists that who made me turn,
I am glad indeed for the sake of itself,
And too that such sweetness has caused me to yearn.

For music so sweet I whisper in return:
To music so sweetly and music so near me, 
do I write sweet things that make me think of her.
