Dear little bird in the bare tree: Where will you fly once the storm comes?

Look, the distant ocean: This morning content,
						 This afternoon it's white-tops
							stirred like down feathers ruffled.

In the distance, before the ocean, the redwoods stand stoic.  
	Perhaps they have withdrawn into themselves; 
		wise and patient as they are in their age.

All while, in the wind, these nearby trees roll their heads and flair their arms.
	They are ecstatic in their youth.
