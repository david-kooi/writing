Delightful repose beneath these theater lights.

~~

Stress has fallen like water released;
	once kept held like glacial ice,
By winter kept held from flowing down
	to lakes from streams.

In one moment elapsed months of pressure,
By sun molten, that grip of stone: Unclasped.

And forth flows water over rivelets and falls,	
Over granite knuckles this water is drawn.

In what variety this water glideth down from 
	it's form of ice,
At it's own sweet will it gurgles forth from glacial mouth,
And roils over the pebbles of the glacial wake.
Drawn to fill the plains of alpine grass;
This day, to me, basks in sun. 

~~

How radiant; still at night beneath these theater lights, 
	my emotion has melted free!
What joy this mood, accented by a ballet rehersal:

Alpine trees staged, pliant,
	to the wind their music danced,
A show to us, the valley floor.
