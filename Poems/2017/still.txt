4/17/17 Still, be still oh heart.  Waver not. Be held in strength;
	   Be fruitful my son.

Patience, my love; wait as you have.
	Spring, this time, is yours: Despair, distraction are frail in the
	Light of God.

Let us Lord, see, Let us Lord, feel your grace.  Your love is steadfast.

Here we stand, amidst the world of fallen intention.  From this we are lifted
to our truest condition: Led my your light, amen.
