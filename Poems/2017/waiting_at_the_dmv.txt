9/15/17

I am one of the many here sitting beneath white fluorescents. 
It is remarkably quiet for a room so filled, like a hive of bees sleeping.

A number of people are attention grabbing:

	Sweet chubby baby sits upon her chair content shuffling 
	and looking about.

	There was a woman who flattered my eyes with her hair brushed 
	neatly to the side, shortened; and confident in her quiet state. 

	A man reminds me of Elvis. Side burns, deep V shirt, wall leaning;
	a victim of love.
