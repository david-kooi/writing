Still my love,
	Why bother so beautiful a heart with worry?

	Such as worry creeps and render itself a part of one-self,
	When worried thoughts seem missing,
		if not thought.

Yet my dear, 
	You are more beautiful without that heavy gown of worry
	weighted over your shoulders. Your heart was made to float
		and smile.

My sweet, 
	Lift your eyes and see heaven. This you have known in your heart,
	that love beyond ourselves is held interlucent within;
		between the parts of ourselves.
