Along the winding path we walk there are places of stillness.
	Where wind is let free to move through pine groves stirred.

The path contines, so must we,
	Forward about the bend.  
Still, God has given us these moments to rest.

The wind comes around like duty to obtrude rest:
	Within the forest grove the wind stirs about yet reaches not that place
		of equaminimity.
