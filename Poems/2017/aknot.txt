My heart is aknot in a barrel empty.

Waves rock and this ship; And our heading is off for the day.

I despair that I woke up too late to see the sun rise,
          that I...  that I...

Still, despite the misdirection,
       despite the morning's beauty,
In the holds within this ship, 
	My heart, aknot, within an empty barrel sits.

Tumbled.
