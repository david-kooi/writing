Beyond the Common Eye
6/26/17

The beauty of morning surpasses the common eye. 

Such how morning is more than the night's cold displaced
	to the shadows of buildings and trees, 
		by the rising sun.

So too, the morning is more than the silhouettes
	set against the misty ridge 
		of eastern mountains. 

Once again this morning sings greetings 
	to another arcing pass 
		of the rising sun.

What more then, is this morning
	than the reflugence of fire 
		beneath the clouds? 

More than morning, is sight and
More than morning, is the moods she brings.

~

This morning, cloud whisps fall like the hair of my only lover.
Your eyes are the sky and they contain the world.

As yet, only a world by my imagination held,
Yet still, she speaks to me with voice unheard,
The way morning speaks to me. 

But her and the morning are 
more than sight and 
more than the mood they bring.
