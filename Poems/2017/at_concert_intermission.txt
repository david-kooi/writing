Lines Written At A Concert Intermission

Upon winged impulse music was sought and delivered
by singing strings.

Tuned to the Four Seasons which pass;
	Timeless melodies make our life,
	bass and harmonies sing upon
		the romance,
			jovilty,
				struggle,
		mishap,
			strife, 
				calamity
		and praise. 

We people join to watch watch and listen to 
	our dreams fortold. 
Mucisians extend themselves as God upon his creation;
	the winds and storms and serenity that move us so
		in reality, is heralded to us by musicians blessed;

Oh, the joy of the Lord!
	It is ours to take grasp.

What awe, amen.
