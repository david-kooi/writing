Lines Written At A Concert Intermission

And upon the winged impulse of music sought and delivered
by singing strings

In tuned to the Four Seasons which pass;
	Timeless melodies that make up our life
	as the bass and harmonies sing upon
		the romance,
			jovilty,
				struggle,
		mishap,
			strife, 
				calamity
		and praise. 

Oh, how we people join to watch wand listen to 
	our dreams fortold. 
Oh, how these mucisians extend themselves as God upon his creation;
	the winds and storms and serenity that move us so
		in pure reality is heralded to us by musicians blessed;
Oh, the joy of the Lord!
	It is ours to take grasp.

What awe, amen.
