Still, be still oh heart.
Waver not. Be held in strength;
	   Be fruitful my son.

Patience, my love; wait as you have.
	Spring, this time, is yours:
	Despair, distraction are frail
	in the Light of God.

Let us Lord see,
Let us Lord feel your grace. 
Your love, oh Lord is steadfast.

Here we stand, amidst the world of fallen intention. 
From this we are lifted to our truest condition: 
Led my your light, amen.

Waves roil unto harbor rocks.
Yet still are waves by the harbor docks,
What could pass this summer's set,
But swaying masts and calm rupples around bow ends?

This is God's presence:
Flowed upon our senses,
Quiet of a restless heart;
Stilled by emotion without time.

5/20/17
And shone a light, Lord
a light before our eyes, Lord
may your light always be seen, Lord
we want our eyes to be open!

Dear Father,
How dear we are in your sign.
We need not prove ourselves; You are and we are in You.
Through the noise you signal; a beacon in the inner most place of our hearts.
Dwell in our hearts we pray Father. Let us know, always: You are Aways, always
with us, closer than our souls to ourselves. 

We love you.

Lord,
We have trained ourselves as dogs to a bell; our minds to the suggestion
of stimulus.

Lord, my God,
These impulses take away from patience, from a single mind.

Lord, 
we are a split people, drawn to whim from whim.
What great love we miss when our minds are not still;
When stillness does not suffice.

Lord,
Raise our hearts,
      out intention towards the light of your son.

Dear Father,
Plants do not grow by the flashing of light. But they grow as constant
sun passes over the day in the motion of planets. Lord,
you endure beyond planets and stars. Still you dwell in us. Let your word be 
water, your presence light, your church the soil in which we grow. 

Amen.
