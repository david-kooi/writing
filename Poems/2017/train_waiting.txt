Unknown date

That single star in the sky reminds us to hope. 

Though we wait in the midst of night, 
together under the orange flow of metro centre lights.

Though our patience is taken by the cold that wraps our arms,
huddled passenges, we wait with hope for transport; a hope not forlorn.

The engine starts and we board. 

Once cold and huddled we are huddled sitting
and swaying and glad that we waited.
