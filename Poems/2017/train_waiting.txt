Unknown date

That single star in the sky reminds us to hope. 

Though we wait in the midst of night, 
together under the orange glow of metro centre lights.

Though our patience is taken by the cold that wraps our arms.
Huddled passenges we wait with hope for transport.

The engine starts and we board. 

Once cold and huddled we are huddled sitting and swaying 
and glad that we waited.
