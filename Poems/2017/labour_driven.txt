Labour driven,

Tiredness of my soul disturbs my integrity. 
Energy spent is energy lost for resilience,
Yet by God's will I endure.

How trunculent this mind; short lengthed from dispair by the
	responsibility of future.
Daylight eclipsed, Heaven shrouded; so rain falls cold.

And what seed shall birth? Light it knows not, in darkness dwell,
	still seedling.
Yet one knows to overcome the gravity of the world and rise into life.
