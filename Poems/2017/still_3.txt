Still my love, we have so far to go,
Still my dear, we will meet again.

As sure as the night bird sings to the moon.
So too does my heart well to thoughts of you.

When would it pass that we may both rest,
From our journeys, our own lives, together at last.

Still my dear,
Still my love,
	The cool night air refreshes our thought.
