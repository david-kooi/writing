Still night, alone by candle light,
In the warmth of a single flame
	that eminates soley to light
	shadows in the name of the Lord.

Outside the cabin walls and windows,
Settles a cold night as water of a glacial lake over
its sea floor. 

A pebble pressed into the sea floor holds up the weight of its weight;
The cold glacial lake: This cabin at night.
