Still night, alone by candle light, In the warmth of a single flame
	that eminates soley to light shadows in the name of the Lord.

Outside the cabin walls and windows, Settles a cold night as water of a
glacial lake over its sea floor.

A pebble pressed into the sea floor holds up the weight of its weight;
The cold glacial lake: This cabin at night.

What then, in the stillness set:
	A quiet heart agitated by tiring circumstance.
Be strong, for you are. Rest in God's presence,
	for home is where the heart is.

And yet, the winds howl without. But they begin to still,
for my heart is still and my will is strong,
	for God is strong.

So subsided, these winds lay as vogel wings folder
within it's mountain nest.
