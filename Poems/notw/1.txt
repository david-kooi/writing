My heart breaths,
	What gratitude I have for the Lord's presence.
		Peace, stillness have overtaken,
			calmed turbulence.

By the grace of God we live.

Of my brother I think, of family,
	Such love have I not felt in my life.
		Spurred is my heart by the Spirit,
		led to places in my heart I had known not;
			time held, time seen,
			time past, time as wind
			time as last, the everlasting.

Our God reaches through the fabric of the universe for our hearts.
He knows our hearts even as we know not.
