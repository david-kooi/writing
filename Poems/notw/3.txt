Spirits assail me beneath my knowledge,
	God save me.
		Jesus, you died for sinners like me.
			Love you are,
			Love you remain.
	Redeem me, I am off balance,
	My Lord, you are and remain
		The hope and my move,
			Save me from myself who is not
				myself, but a fraud seeking
					self sation.
			Deliver me from lust,
			Deliver to me compassion, my God.
		My repentance is recognition,
		My behavior is volitile.

	My Lord, still you love me.
	Lead me Jesus to deeper recognition of 
		your salvation and a truer approach to
		who I am, child of yours, disobedient,
			yet striving for purity and rightousness.

Spirits assail me, yet,
You my God, my savior, have overcome.
You, our Lord are love.

Amen.
