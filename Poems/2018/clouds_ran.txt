3/16/18

The clouds ran head-strong over the sea,
	Pushed by the light and wind
They ran determined; glid in single stride
	from the horizon, stepping toward the land beyond.
Like a note held, over measures, 
				  over cities and fields.

Then I turned the other way, and entered the city.

~

The train decended into the underground. 
But it was stopped and held between granite walls.
We jerked forward and tunnel lights flew by the windows. 
The clatter of doors and moan of tracks repeated, clumsily;
Perhaps a sign of the times.

~

The fire raged and destroyed.
We watch the world burn inside glass windows.
Music and drink are served and we are glad of our safety;
The flames reach not our side of the street.

Flames consume and we watch in amusement.
Embers float, smoke billows, we take photos.
Firemen struggle for life
While we hope we can finish our drinks.


~

We left, our lives moved on.
Discord and harmony: The homeless under the bridge, huddled.
				     Friends beneath the sun, joyous. 
~

The clouds pass as time over a thousand measures,
A single note held.
