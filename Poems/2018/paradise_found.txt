2/16/18

I stumbled upon paradise,
	Where birds sing, 
	and waters roil.

The stillness befits 
	The moss where upon I rest;
Above the cloves, a carpet,
Along the trail, hidden
By the river, a gentle presence. 

I stumbled upon paradise,
	Where now sun sets,
And bid farewel, until I walk these paths again.

Eight days gone since through these trees I walked.
A different age of myself
Returns to an enduring place.

Behind foilage scampered a creature;
To it I called attention, and attention called back.
A man upon a leafy ledge watch wary as I approached,
His hound cautiously eyeing
The stranger that came close.

"You live round here?" The man asked.
To which I said, "I do."
"Been here long?" The man asked,
To which I said, "I have".
"My name is Brian" The man said,
"And how do you, how do you do?"

He spoke fondly of the land:
"Ridges and valleys lay before you,
Vast spans of little walked ground,
Over these my wife Robin and I trek,
Scavanging for mushrooms to be found."

Then through the tree she appeared beside him.

Ten more days hence I sat last
	upon this moss covered trunk. 
A new season has opened,
Rain came blowing against our walls,
Of sound like rivers near,
No longer a roil like jovial rain,
Rather the noise of wind blown sheer.

Rain came wet in the depth of night,
And I lay awake wondering what the river might bring.
