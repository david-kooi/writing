Think, think, think goes the woodpecker at night,
Do, do, do, does the dove during day.

All the creatures of the forest 
	work, work, work,
		do, do, do,
			think, think, think.
Such is the nature of the old forest. 

Think, 
	What, why, how, when, who, who,
	What do I do?
	What do I do?
Think,
	Why, why, why?
	Why is it so?
Think,
	When, when,
	When will it be?
Laments the woodpecker,
See how frustrated is he.

Do, do!
	Do crows the dove,
	Do more, do more!
	Do crows the dove.
Do, do!
	I do to show, 
	I do to win,
	I do to prove I'm qualified to do!
Do, do!
I try to do my best to do,
I do my best to be,
The dove signs, oh,
See how tired is she.

~~

We walk the path between the trees,
And look not to the sky,
We walk heads down so we might bear, 
The weight of the toiler's crown.

The squirrel sighs,
The birds do sit; 
Tired of their working flight.

The bear looks not for berries blue,
	All his wonder is gone.

So too, so too, the rabbits dwell,
	No energy to leave their dell,
They sit and watch their world go by,
	as they trudge to back to work.

Such is the nature of the old forest.
Time has stricken all creatures with fear.
So they build their treasures on Earth.

But not all lament,
For some believe,
A forest new one day,
In remedy to all groaning,
will one day re-appear.
