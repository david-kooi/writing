Graduation
Draft

Edge of a moment
	Felt the ground beneath my feet,
In a garden rock, imperfect,
	Is where life grows from seed.

Seeds of ideas, sprout into light,
	Little, fragile effort,
Brought forth by the mind.

Take and perished and planted again,
	Our ideas created, ideas of men.

Fickle and delicate, blown by our time,
	Spent working and studying,
Building and building,
	Students of life.

Life given in days and their years,
	Life it's own garden,
Imperfect, mishapen, 
	and still to us so dear.

Our roots have deepened,
	So have we learned,
Our trades, our roots to dig to the depths,
	Where we can drink what the world would supply.

Grown as we have, to reach deep and up high,
	Trees we are, out streatching this day,
We are now useful, to benifit human kind.

In this garden we are watered and watered
	to scale, of the fruits and use that we
Have learned to give.

Water not the weeds, go easy on the flowers,
	They are nice, but the fruits
Are what really matters.

This day, I and my collegues shall sit,
	Bestowed to us honors that we plants
Are deemed fit.

We have grown and learned the ways of the land,
	and how to make fruit if watered by man.

And what would happen if that water is gone?
And roots become shallow,
and leaves start to shrink,

How well if the bird settled from seed and nested when known,
How well if that bird, well fed in it's days and
	within your branched a home, and
	watered by rain and means not of man,
How well if that spirit, back to the heavens is sent.
