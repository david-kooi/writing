Santa Cruz

I love this French lady! She stands set,
narrating the thoughts of her mind to the audiance of her contemplation.

The music draws! We overlook the sea blue upon the horizon,
    above and below.
There I sit, we sit as friends for a moment,
    joined by the bench we sit and the music that
    joins our attention.
Little children run past,
    Smiling as the sun upon us;
Unbided by the clouds of responsibility.

Groovin' their jig, speedy ting!
    My friend has got a beer,
Music and sun is all I'd ask for, 
    thank you very much for playing.
Groovy and feel,
    over the ocean we watch and
    let the rays of sun and music upon our hearts drop.
Katherine, sweet as can be, rolled up her electric chair to me,
           sweet to be joined for the moment along this day!

Little boy keeps circling past pushing his bike,
"Groovy boy" I say, and next to me he says: 
"With a smile that gets bigger, bigger every time!"

The old and young:
Large, cool hung leather jacket drawn, a stag.
    Little and stumbling, like a fawn.
Broad sholdered, shades flashing, this father.
    On wobbly wheels, lop-sided helmet, his son.

A sunday bike outing along the cliffs,
Dad checks and practices an eye brow raise to the mirror,
    Son is looking for his right shoe.

I am exstatic. Beats and beats, so he says: "Ya man".

The musicians keep strumming like the waves drawn to shore,
    drawn together and and on the beach with a crash of groove.

Wave rider upon the seas,
    Monterey Bay morning,
Walking the babies on Capitola sands,
While whales are breaching out on the seas.
