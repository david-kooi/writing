Summer 2014


Celebrated Sabbath with Hebrew Christians last night.  Brought us in like
prodigal sons.

We ate, and ate, and ate.  God! We were drunk with food!

From the Hebrew Christians we received God’s blessing.

 Then we staggered back to our camp along the river,
And slept under the Oregon stars.

The next morning we swam in the river.  We’d swim upstream with power
strokes, Then we let our bodies fall with the gravity of the current.

Thought some listened some: Wind rustles between the trees that line both banks
of the river.  A small white river bird warbles the sounds of it’s name.

Faint brum of motors in the distance:
	We are still in a city.

A city:
	People, community, lives, desires, problems, motivations:
		An cornucopia of experience.


Later we picked black berries.	Thorns snagged pants.  Tongues prickled .
Lips, fingers black.

We walked across the parking lot and worshiped with the Church of the Vine.
We were blessed by the ones who care for the weak.  $40 in our pockets and
prayers for safe travels.  Authentic charity.

Eastward sun rose over the far bank: t’s early morning.  Thoughts of a
long day enter my mind.  We aim south for Eugene.


, along the gentle North flowing river of Salem.
