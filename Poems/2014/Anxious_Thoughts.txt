(Early 2014)

It is always the hardest at night. When the weight of the day and the days
to come lay on your shoulders.

You question your mode of operation, your effectiveness your knowledge because
if you were really on top of things these anxieties would not arise, right?

I know I must sacrifice. But of what?

I must keep pushing.

To write. To free write. To write free from distraction, free from
formality. To express without thought. For sometimes thought muddles
perception\

Oh where has time gone? Lost beneath the turbulent waves of the could dos
and must be dones.  Freedom lost between the waves?  Innocence lost behind
the everyday haze.

It annoys me that people buy $70 ray bans, $100 shoes and $300
smartphones. Then they drive their SUVs to starbucks to buy $10 lunches. But
they do not have the dignity to look into the eyes of a person who is asking
for financial help let alone give them a couple bucks that will not be missed.
