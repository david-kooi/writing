Over rock and under brush we treked,
	Into a land where sentinels watch,
And for reasons known by man alone,
	To the vast and gentle expanse respect we gave not.

Though by tremendous force did these 
	continental slates push and strain,
		up through a surface man can only dare scratch,
			did we not see the majesty that no hand crafted art may match.

Whisps of wind, specific to each valley’s folds,
	Along with reflected light, scattered into colors of a perfect painted 
		rainbow 
			formed an image of vast expanse.

Hills and mountains rose and fell until the end of sight.
	They hold the texture of a long dynamic history.

Oh the pleasure to be part of one of the Earth’s infinite 
	moments: 
		To realize reality once more.
Almost overwhelming yes, but it’s something that keeps you 
	longing for more.
Peering down into the valleys we started to outline forms and feelings
	so often lost in cities,
		the Art, the Music, the Ecstasy of pure nature’s divine. 

And the realization of a light gone missing, of love gone missing
	began to abound within our hearts. Each breath pushed the heart,
		Because we began to see:
			The clouds starting to part.

			Holy light began to displace the mundane gray,
				Yet the source of light was blocked by the hill
					Where at the base we sat and thought.
			And in that moment up the hill
				We gave a running start.

“To the top, to the top!” I urged my mates. 
	For I knew there we would find the light. 
		I knew, so I ran. 

Step…and step…breath…and breath.
The pace of time began to slow.
And as our eyes over the hilltop did rise	
	They were blinded by streams of liquid gold.
