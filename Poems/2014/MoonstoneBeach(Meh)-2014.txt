Summer 2014

An overcast, ocean-side morning. 

Northern California, Moonstone Beach. 

Slept in to a comfortable time.
Although thoughts of early risings were on my mind
during the waning hours of the night.

Walk past the extruding rocks,
like teeth of the earth.

Walk past the families:
	Fathers, Mothers, on temporary leave from
	bureaucratic workspace.
	
	Fathers, Mothers, whose work is temporary 
	leave from family non-haste.

Walk onto the beach:
	Footsteps will become heavy with the drag of sand,

Walk until you reach a line of trees.
That run along the Eastern length of the North-South oriented beach. 

And between some trees, among the bushes colored green,
You might see a pathway leading into a sacred grove,
Or, perhaps, that door way might remain unseen.

But if you walk past the families, the rocks, and into those trees you will see:
	A meticulous assortment of items;
	All that is needed for a home:

The comfort of food…thought out to last a span of days.
Dry ground to lay rest weary heads after long days of work.

Music, though at rest can be heard faintly through two flues sleeping in their enclosing sleeves.
