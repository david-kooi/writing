Summer 2014 


A small, high velocity projectile, spawned somewhere
in the universe burnt up while entering our atmosphere.

—

A meandering river flows slowly past my sight.

The stars rotate about a central axis;
	Earth rotation.
	West to East.

Of home, of food, of friends
	and tendencies I wish to be routine.

These thoughts flow through my head:
	My mind a river whose depth 
		cannot be seen from the shallow end.
	

All to be balanced on the blade of a knife.
Breath in, breath out.
Everything will turn out just right.
