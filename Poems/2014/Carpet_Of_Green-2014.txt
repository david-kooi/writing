Summer 2014

A carpet of green supports a body lying in shade.
His thoughts wander like the splashes of golden light
	that flicker down through the pine needles and softly 
		land upon shaded grass.

Drifting thoughts…they come…
	fade…arise…fade…

Thoughts like smoke:
Full, tangible by the mind’s fire…
	Only for the images to drift off like smoke 
		that has been grasped by wind.

This man’s hat brim
	lays low over his face,
He feels the simple world of 
	grass and trees,
		sun-warmth,
			and buzzing bees
That fly between flowers,
	He has lost the hours,
To the force of feeling,
	
Of	
	Well…
		Feeling simply.
