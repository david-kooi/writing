Outside of an Albertsons
Fall 2014


Watching the yuppies drive their new cars and trucks:
	Factory Detailing still fresh…	
		Thanks Mom and Dad.

Fast lives, but not by years.
Fast lives by the status’ and posts
	of peers.

Packaged, boxed, clean cut
	new clothes:
Indonesian made…check out my branded stuff.

Branded:
	How ranchers mark their cattle.
Branded:
	How marketers make you think you
		matter.

Quick food, it’s all shit…
	Thrown together mush with 
		oily sweet sauce.

Of 100 things from the ‘super market’ 
93 you have no need to pocket:
	The modern market is a house of illusion.
			Hell, that’s the purpose right?
				Mass market consumer confusion.

The logic is sound:
	Distribute products,
	Manufacture need.
	Use TV to plant the infant seed.

When the fruit is ripe for picking,
Give them plastic cards,
Then give them permission to live lives
	like those on television.

But there is a catch:
	The cars, quick food, yoga pants, hierarchal social-class…
	
Is non sustainable…this resource draining culture cannot last.

— 

And here is proposal for thought:

Thought that must be done about the way we live our lives,
About looking up from our phones,
About seeing through our own eyes:
	Not though the eyes of marketers,
	Not though the eyes of psudo-need…
But though the eyes of the land,
The eyes of fellow woman and man,
To see what and who we really are:
	One planet,
	One people.

And that the power of change is within our hands.
