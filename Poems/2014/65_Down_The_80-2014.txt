65 down the 80.
Just picked up two stragglers and their dawg.
Asked me where I was headed. I said East, East to Lovelock.

Mah cycle’s leaking oil,
Told the folks to throw their packs as far back as they could.
Was planning’ on ridin’
But now I got these two…So I think tomorrow I should.

Going’ 65 down the 80. Just another day on the road.
 Thought I’d pick up some traveling folk…spice up another day
driving’ this big sky road.
