Summer 2014

Rest, Rejuvenation.

We heal within the woods,
With the birds, with grass
	and other plants.

Our bodies and minds are too given life by the sun.

Mental efforts are forgotten in the wind;
Our sight of the fallen trees,  The ones with leaves,
Plants which create worlds for bees,
All come into focus.

Within these woods we heal.
Rejuvenation, Rest.
