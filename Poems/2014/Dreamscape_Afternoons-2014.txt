Summer 2014

Lazy…raining morning.

Birds sing their crooked songs;
	What do they jammer about?

The smell of damp soil floats to your nose.

Rain drops lightly tap our overhead tarps as if
	they are asking:
		“Anybody home?”

Our bodies lie cozy and dry
	within synthetic cocoons.

Our minds drift from place to place… Drifting from this lazy raining morning
	to hazy dreamscape afternoons.
