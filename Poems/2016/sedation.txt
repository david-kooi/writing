Summer 2016

Sedation of a tired mind
Drops below sill waters and sinks
	into the murk with a cloud of dust.

Idleness during a fall from 
a balcony where time has slowed one's
flailing arms, but has kept the pull of
	gravity.

Expansion of the mind into a realm
	of machine pieces. 
Inner workings of a clock only show 
	what is missing under watchful eye. 

Yet, this mind is tired and falls slowly
	through the water, shackled to 
		missing machine pieces.
