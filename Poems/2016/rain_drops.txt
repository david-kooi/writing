Spring 2016

Rain drops pitter-patter
on the roof and down the gutter.

Here I lay one foot away from breezes, 
From the chill,
	on the dry side of the wall.

Through a hole of covered glass I watch
	and hold my covers,
Hold my breath for I do think,
That when released, 
	I might fall through the bed, 
		and past the sheets, 
			fall from the sky, 
				my heart stopped still,
					on my way to heaven's gate.
But first through storm clouds,
	flung among tempest winds 
		above this sleepy town. 

And back to the comfort of my bed.
