Timing Threads
August 2016

Behold, strands of thread,
Unwound themselves to the fraying end:
Unraveled twine pulled apart 
    as fingers spread once 
        braided hair.
Threads of a long stretched moment,
Once bound tight and pulled, now let loose, 
    let apart. 

Ends of a moment, held dear for what they carried.
Yet time unthreads if no load pulls tight against
it's core strings of enthropy.
