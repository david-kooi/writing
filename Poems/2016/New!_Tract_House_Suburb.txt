2016

Once the sparrows flew
    And wind blew through these fields.
Now smog and soot are belched by smoke stacks
    and cigars;
greedily inhaled by profiteers; the damned men.

Begrudging decline of the land we used to know; Oh the pastures of our lambs!
Now strip malls and traffic jams; Like the open range lands and individual
driven stock!  Now fenced and bartered by New York stock owners.  Sustinance,
sufficancy, unbeknownst to thy consumer.  What consumption; sown by the hand
of Cain, Reaped by the hands of men.

Trampled this simple life, my love. Our dreams, broken corn stalks.  When in
youth we thought to live among the streams and rivers and raise our children
among the calves and sell wool clothes in the town.

To live in harmony with all around And sing of spring and winter's leaving!
Compose songs in harp and flute And write the language of birds,

Is this not what we sold our lives for?  Leave the city like pioneers,
buy the tools, stock the feed, and live within humble needs?

Now these mountains are bear and ripped apart.  Between the trees: The trails
we used to walk, Now dust and stumps.

The fields where we loved and lay by gurguling creeks, That pine tree where
beneath I laid you to rest, Vanquished! A barren waste. They have hauled
away all the life.  Oh, it seemed that just yesterday I placed flowers upon
your grave.

How I miss you dear. Perhaps we would have a chance, Had you not been stricken
by sullen circumstance.  Yet we might see each other soon, for the smoke
stacks never yield, I've gained a black cough, too.

Earthly dreams conveyed in lands of no light, Falter as grasses amid the
onset of never ending summer.
