To write. To write, to express perception without bounds.  Always be there,
never falter, never fall back into the routine of it all.  To live with
one. To see through time slowed lenses.

To watch the water slip down green carpets of moss from level to level.

To see the small critter cross this very page, not a tresspaser, but a friend
with whom to spend a moment.
