I dream for love; for another.

God! I have tasted the rapture;
	The simplest flavor of skin, tenderness of lips,
	The triumph and exultation
		which arise as bubbles in stone.
		This heart a rock was melted by your touch, my love.

		What was once granite is willed to move. My chest
			fills with the air of comfort and understanding; thank God
			I may feel again.

God! You show me glimpses.

	Seen the eyes who see in return. Eyes open with purity and conviction.

	I have heard the cantos of youthful wisdom: Aspiration.
	I have heard fluent monologues brought forth from encouragment and elation
		so gratefully recieved and freely given.
