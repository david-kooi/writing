I dream for love; for another.

God! I have tasted the rapture;
	The simplest flavor of skin, tenderness of lips,
	The triumph and exultation
		which arise as bubbles in stone.
		This heart a rock was melted by your touch.

		What was once granite is free to move. Breath in a rising chest
			filling with  the air of comfort and understanding.

God! You show me glimpses.

	Seen the eyes who see in return. Eyes open with purity and conviction
	that the one held in their arms is their most nobel prediction.

	I have heart the cantos of youthful wisdom: Aspiration.
	Of fluent monologues brought forth from encouragment and elation
		so gratefully recieved and freely given.
