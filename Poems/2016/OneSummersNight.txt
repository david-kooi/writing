One Summer's Night July 2016

The experiances and interactions of the past day amount to the leaves on a
sapling tree, grown along its branches, in the light of the sun: New leaves
popping forth, one by one.

Together they billow like a sail,
	leaves flurling in the wind.

How fast these moments happen! Like a bee blown between flowers at the mercy
of the wind: Such was I, wandering.  Instead of bumble stripes I had drawn
around myself, a silken cloth of moonlit white and forest green; courtesy
of a woodland elf.

Thus draped in the garmets of the wind and forest moss, We followed the
heart's daring call, and danced between the light and shadow of the trees,
while over my shoulder poured that silken waterfall.

With delicate steps did we follow a changing music of a changing season;
Slow turns of gentle summer rhythms, Quick steps of a winters swing, And
spins as falling leaves when wind blows them from autumn trees.

How we danced! Among the ruins of our sensibilities.  Until we fell as
falling stars, caught by clouds wherin we lay to look up at the dream we left,
a palace of stars and jewels of galaxies.
