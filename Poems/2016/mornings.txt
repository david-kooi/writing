Mornings
June 2016

Half conscious in a cocoon of bed sheets;
The mind focuses, eyes awaken, but
with a turn all senses are enveloped silks of sedation 
and pulled into some fretful state of comfort, migraine, delay;
Until one crawls out from cluttered sheets, 
a butterfly awoken from deep sleep:

Sticky wings. Dry mouth and weary eyes,
Head shaking off the cobwebs of the night.
