2016

Orange flame burn. Light the mysteries of the 
dark room in which we dwell.

Day to day we pace the four walls. Routine this is called.
We know the cabinets, chairs, and furniture that fill the room.
We could walk the walls and know exactly where they are.

I wish to walk with orange flame to see subtly. 
To see the waves in the wood grain. To see shadows flicker
off table legs. 

(Illuminate the ordinary)
