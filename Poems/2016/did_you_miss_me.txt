7/5/16

Did you miss me when I left,
    and take love for the night?
Or harbor affection, while enclosed within canyon walls,
by the flame of camp fire light?

My time is quick to pass before I set another day,
So let us enjoy the time we have,
And pretend that forever here will stay.

I look fondly on you from far away, 
It is the only thing I can do,
besides light the dark in anyway I can,
And give warmth to the trees, grass, valleys and hills.
This I give freely...
When I can.

Clouds sometimes come between us; Then I miss you dear.
How I love the art we make, shadow play,
How I love the colors there.
