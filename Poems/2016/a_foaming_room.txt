9/15/16

Commotion of a foaming room; bubbling towards the ceiling
and out the door. Gurgling force driving the stream through spaces of
buried soil, rocks within our minds. Turtile, barren, rock,
digital geology. Minds feel water upwelling to the surface.

Aggregation of individuals grasped together as bubbling thoughts up
through the recesses of their minds. A fountain foaming forth into this room
with commotion.
