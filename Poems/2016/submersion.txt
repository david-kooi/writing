Submersion (into insurpassable solitude) 2016

Where is fortitude? Steadfastness?  Determination of will?  I pick scraps
as a dog from the dinner table of character.

Agony of conciousness.  How baren these valley walls and chilled this
    glacier's breath.
Hollow burned out trunk of my soul: That which trying winds blew and fell;
Unrooted toppled into that valley where once began Those thoughts of my
own enlightenment.

My days glory the repulsion of feeling.  This undoing, this unbidding torment
of my wants Flashed before my eyes and taken away; This grasping, tearing,
displacement aches for resolve yet attains naught but an endless rope strung
around my neck(heart).
