On mist wrapped hills dew collects on leaflets and grass blades to slip down
like the passing of moments:

Feelings slip, phases pass; when once we talked and smiled, now beyond our
immidiate thought, those times have slid down the stalk to water the soil
of who we are.

Clouds lay weighted above the trees And rise but arms length; Laden as flight's
dream calls up a leap, but pulls one, in slow motion, back down to one's feet.
(Look, even clouds cry for their ascention.)

I see Britian in the clouds.  The rising sun warms her coast, And rays of
morning pass around Scattered whisps of ocean waves, To illum her mountains
in whitened gold With shadows cast over her eastern end, As shadowed as are
these lands below.

Now the sun raises fully stretched, And flocks of birds mark a checkered sky
Before it contracts and pulls together, These birds, this day, A streaking
feather, An oncoming night.
