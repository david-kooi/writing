2016

Upon mercurial waves we float,
	Drawn and swayed
		by currents, led by spirits to tops of wave
		crests and down to the hollowed depths of quietude.
		(Still we rise, verdamnt sinusoid.)

	Oh, bless the day of the muse!
	When inspiration swirls about like rose pedals in a whirl pool.
	When narrative blooms like flowers in a sun lit forest grove.
		(We intuit these things, you see.)

	God, then romance sweeps the mind away 
	to sail turbulent waves of bed sheets 
	that rise and fall 
		kicked about my restless arms 
			and legs.
		(How pretty, how depressed, our mind's unrest)

	Oh, how the mind wishes to sleep,
	But the heart beats with restless longing.
		(To be stilled. But,)

	Morning comes and with it the clarity of day.
	And I rightfully berate the nonsense of lofty thoughts,
	Then too, embrace the nonsense of lofty thoughts.
		(What fun would that be?)

	Amen.
