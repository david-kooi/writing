2016

Upon mercurial waves we float,
	Drawn and swayed
		by currents, led by spirits to tops of wave crests and down
		to the hollowed depths of quietude.

	Oh, bless the day of the muse!	When inspiration swirls about like
	rose pedals in a whirl pool, And narrative blooms like flowers in
	a sun-lit forest grove.

	God, then romance sweeps the mind away to sail turbulent waves of
	bed sheets that rise and fall
		kicked about my restless arms and legs.

	Oh, how the mind wishes to sleep, But the heart beats with restless
	longing.


	Morning comes and with it the clarity of day.  
		And I rightfully berate
			the nonsense of lofty thoughts, 
		Then too, embrace 
			the nonsense of	lofty thoughts.
