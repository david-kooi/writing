Closing summer nights as 
palm trees illumed in golden
light lack luster with the settings sun.

Moon rise and cool winds append the sun and warmth
of day. Yet the music carries through!

Galloping, Piercing,
Pinning and coutnring my attention with
sounds as timeless as the orange sky. 

Passions as a means in themself; equal measures given
and received: Relection of a dancing flam that burns
timeless fueled by its own light: Sweet music.

Changed seasons, a door closed.
Embedded in thus door, a copper lock:
Sun and moon, rotation shut as day turned night.
