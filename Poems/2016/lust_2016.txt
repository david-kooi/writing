I have smelled lust.

	From another, but not returned.
	To another, but intention spurned.

But for each other can exist a list ripened by time and flabored by imagination;
Such that the ripened branch bears a peach so sweet when you bite
	you must retract lest be overcome by sweetness running by your lips.
