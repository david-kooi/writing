2016

If there ever is tomorrow, might the sky still be blue?  Should the herron
still fly over
	lakes and fields
When the world's breath to stale crypt yields,
	And the clouds cover drab and wilted views?

My love, our passing was a season.
	And as winter hopes
		for spring time hold,
			scarce can I find reason
				To leave my heart in hopeless pieces,
While the snow begins to melt and grasses to show.
