Furnace
December 2015

Melt the iron ingot of my heart
that has been shaped throughout the days
into a cold sphere heavy to the hand. So may
the flames of furnace hearth be by touch and whisper fanned 
    to bring color to an overcast day 
        And restore rivers where once ice lay
            Frozen and withdrawn,
                to molten channels flowed
                    from a melting heart.
