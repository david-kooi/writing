Stars and Gems
August 2016

Stories embed themselves into routine like jewels 
	in concrete sidewalks.

Walk alone on Saturn's rings, hands in pockets 
	kicking loose stones off the edge
		into space's black abyss
			where they fall with comet tails
				to embed themselves as stars 
					in the expanse of the night. 

Stars and gems:
	Randomness of our shuffles from day to day.
	
	Intention of the sidewalk builder who lays 
		the path whereon we walk.
