Thoughts Through Summer Compression July 2016

Oh for grief and pale nervousness,
	my heart beats for reasons unknown.

Wherefore comes anxiousness?  Why does it stay?  What might alieve these
fragile ways?

Melt this heart I pray to the balmy summer wind, 
Still these waters so I may gaze back at the sky  
Through my eyes that are alpine pools which hath
	been disturbed by sudden storm.

For too long have I clenched my hand, 
A glacier's grip upon the rocks.
For many days have I held storm clounds
	among these mountain tops.

Clear these waters I pray, So sky and light and scattered clouds
	may sink
		within the deep
			and light the roots of my eyes.
