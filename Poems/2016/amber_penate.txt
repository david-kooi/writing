Amber Penate August 2016

Amid these mountains I once sat As a boy I ran from such displeasures as
	company, trivialty:
To find a more sublime experiance than depricating conversation and social
exclusion.

I ran to the only place of quiet I knew, And lounged in the sun on an
aged tree.  I watched as before me the ravens flew, And took hold of a this
timeless quality.

That kind raven placed into my hand A penate of amber sunset framed by clouds
of whiteness, milky against the amber sky.  And trees, little glimmers of
darkened amber lines.

Like other colored stone, down the middle cracked: Opening to it's depth,
This penate's expression, A reflection of this mountain's valley fold.

What fancy this held, known by my mind alone: Sky and cloud and ragged cliffs,
Steep brush speckered granite rifts, Illuminated from within, as if there
a sun shone.

Unfolding flowers and swirling scents, Dear God, what a dream hath opened
before me?  I knew not the dispair of the coming morning And stood transfixed
before the sunset.

I placed into my pocket over my heart, That glowing aumlet and a handful of
flowers, And sung songs down the mountain and returned
	Home after night had fallen.

To my dismay,
	the flowers had all but wilted the next day.
How alone, when my friends on the baseball benches,
	saw naught but pebbled stone.
