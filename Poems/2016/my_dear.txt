Spring 2016

My dear,

I writhe with passions of the mind.
My heart flies and carries me from my place
	to landscapes beyond. 

I think of you, in simple ways.
Involved conjecture is often false.
But we communicate in simple ways,
that language we both speak.

You are a mere though in the corner of my head.
That is all,
	And I am glad you are there.

Wind, wind within my mind
	blows leaves of stone littered
	on my lawn.

Place and time were briefly ours.
And I fell in love, of fated delusion!

So sweet thy wine. I fell in love with
	the one who could touch her heart to mine.
So resonant, her heart sings,
Melodies composed by the greater world:
	Flowers in sun,
	Summer at dusk, 
	A flower touched breeze,
	Leaves, orange, cusp the evening light
		and tell of the warmth that has filled these days. 
So did your heart sing.

How I love the sky and fields,
	blue and golden before my eyes.
Sweet drink, sweet the muse that hath
	graced Byron and Wordsworth,
So too graces me and too,
	has graced you.
Of these your heart sings and so too,
	touches mine.
