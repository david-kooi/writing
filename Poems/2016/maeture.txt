Maeture hopped onto a fallen tree then shuffled its paws up the incline and leaped for a rising pine. It's furry hind-paws extended their talons while it's hands grasped for the trunk. Maeture pushed itself up the tree. It's talons found cracks and holes while it's hands searched for obtrusions and branches. After climbing a minute Maeture found a branch. It perched there, on the canopy limb, it's tail swaying as it balanced on it's hind paws. All of a sudden Maeture pulled its ears pulled back and leaped. Rushing wind rippled it's fur. Maeture's eyes fixed on the ground. In an instant Maeture threw open its wings and tilted back. It's talons plucked up a mushroom and widthdrew. Maeture flapped hard and rose to another tree to enjoy it's snack.
