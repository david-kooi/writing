Oh veil my eyes,
	I see through walls,
		see the mirth and troubles that befall
			a fallen race that has lost
				sight of the eyes of Good.

Dear Lord, I see waht could be 
	and what is of your creation,
I pray you show the way of hope,
	into the arms of your salvation.

The angels weep for our seperation,
	while they fly amidst holy light, they see
		their cousins amidst,
			from afar, on a small planet,
				in the dark void of space.
And oft they reach into our lives and make wrong from right;
	and open one's heart to the secrets of God.

While I dream of laying with snakes.
