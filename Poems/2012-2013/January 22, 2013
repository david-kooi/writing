8:14 AM


I would normally consider this early for me, but I have to say that I am 
feeling pretty good right now. 

Last night was a bit tossy, but I feel well rested and ready to take the day 
on.

I feel like I have the world in my hands with this type of morning functional-
ity. I have so much time to. After writting I will drink some tea and read
a book, then get dressed. And plan the day. 

I can do this.
