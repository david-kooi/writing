In regards to the little paradox that has formed: " If teen pregnancy is more socially acceptable, why are teen births going down?"

It seems to me that the social acceptability of teen pregnancy is caused by the social acceptibility of teen sex.So I would have to say that it seems the decline of teen birth rates is in part a result of corporate sociologists and psycologists who have recognized that teen sex has indeed become more acceplable. 

In response to a market that was beginning to emerge due to this rise in social acceptability, contraception was more vigoriously marketed [Trojan comercials...condom billboards] and in turn teens gained an awareness that they were able to safely indulge in the sexual actions and ideas that were(and are) being presented as socially acceptable by the media. 

Social acceptable teen sex ---> increased social acceptability of teen pregnacy
Social acceptable teen sex---> increased awareness in contraception----> decline in teen birth rates
