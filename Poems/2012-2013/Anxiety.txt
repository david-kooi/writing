2012

It is a foreboding feeling. One that lurks in the back of your head, constantly nagging and telling you something is wrong. No matter what you think, this sense of anticipation never goes away. Alas, it does not seem even to want to. One grows used to it. You ignore it, but you still know it is there\'85brooding cynicism over the important aspects of your life.  It is that feeling of standing on the high dive waiting to jump off. It is that feeling manifested into the mundane and routine occurrences of life. 

Damn it. Damn it to hell. And if I cant damn it, Ill show that its existence cannot phase me. Because I can, and will live my life the way I want. 

I will not be fettered by the chains of my own creation.
