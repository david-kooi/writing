2013

I write near the aged creek of Slo,
Near waters which down to Avila flow,
Of thought and emotion that dwell out of sight.

Of motivation and of vision:
I lay course between wave smooth rocks,
My mind speaks and my body listens.

This is a strange power we attain,
Once one one's ability discovers,
Once one one's inner peace uncovers,
A never changing wind-vane 
To steer our ship out of danger. 

Navigation is never straight and true.
Rocks rise at any moments instant.
Trouble arises if danger goes unseen.
One must see beneath the waters light colored hue.
