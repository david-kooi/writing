First day of the new year. 

Im not sure what it feels like....

On one hand it feels like another lap on the track. Another check point in 
a race that is run. 

On the other hand it feels like another day, as if life is just a straight
continuous path that keeps going till long into the future. 

Let me take into consideration the occurrences of 2012. It began in Hawaii.
At this point of my life, I was busy trying to make sense of a complex world.
Can't say I am not doing that right now. But during the beginning of 2012
I think I discovered my love for the subtle. The hidden meanings behind what 
we normally take for granted. The idyllic world of sensibility. 

Granted, the world is not is difficult to navigate when naivety comes into 
play. [Read my entry on naivety]

Time went by, I graduated...decided to go to Cuesta college...moved out...
was thrust into a world of independence...and now am taking my first long 
post semester break. 

I was prepared for the independence handed to me. I embraced it. I was [might 
still be] so awed by the idea of personal development through independent 
means that my social life was not all to apparent. But, while seemingly taboo
the popular though, I enjoy a lifestyle of independence, development, and 
personal progression. 

And yet this way of life continually comes into conflict with the world's 
pragmatic utility. 

Which brings me to my New Year's resolution: To Life With Conviction.

It seems that the link between independent development and the pragmatic is 
with a conscious knowledge of purpose.

As I enter this year full of new possibility, I pray that I will be able to
live my life to the highest potential. To exert myself beyond what I was
once capable of.

I pray that if it is his intention, that God will  bring me back to my 
Christian beliefs.
