Summer Rain 
2012


You come as an unexpected guest.

In the guise of a restaurant regular. 
	It has been a long time since you walked through the doors,
		Yet you are still a familiar face to the cooks and servers.


In mellow colors you are dressed.
	The sun finds cracks between the clouds,
		Lighting and warming the damp grass,
			Where perhaps two lovers in a park have lain.			

I thank God for the sound of natureâ€™s call.
	And likewise, I thank God for the smell of
		summer rain.
