To College 2012


I stand on the shore of dawnâ€™s early day, 
The voyage of the night fading from vision.

I feel the pull of the organized say:

Wants for myself and the being I want,
Collide together: The other may not.

Moving out to sea with warm wind in sail.  
So I ask: Where will our crossroads meet?  

Time is set to book,
Strengthened by so many feet.
