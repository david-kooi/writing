2012

Quietly sitting under history's branches,
Silent serenity flows, lights, and fades.
I wonder if nature can see me.
Or is she blind, indifferent like justice's face?

All percieved at once, my senses fail to complain.
They breath freely, taking in all the world has to say,
Questioning such trivialties: Am I really me?

The world says, yet we choose,
To pick our own meanings,
Establish our own virtues
In light of a higher power's clues.

But what is the satisfaction of these throughts
Compared to the loving gratifaction, you, my loving lady
alots.
