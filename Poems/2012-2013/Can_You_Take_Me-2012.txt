Can You Take Me?
2012

Can you take me to a place where an inner light in shown?
Where love and peace extend
	beyond the realm of ones own.

Can you take me to a place where love is all around?
	Where the sound of joy and peace freely resound.

Come with me to a land far from societies mouth. We will find 
	serenity between the trees,
		and our linguistic capacities shall fail:
Fail to explain our senses within the 
	words of show and tell.

Will someone not join me to such a romantic place?
Letâ€™s envision a seeking of an ideal global face. 

But really this occurs:
A car showing of persons, places, events, and worlds.
And you become part of the mass suggestion 
	simply based on what you have heard.
