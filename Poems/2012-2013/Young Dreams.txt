(Shell Writings 2012)

There is a vast expanse ahead of us. Itâ€™s ground, the foundation of our dreams. There is a beacon on the horizon. A light created by our goals and dreams. It shines, calling us to itself. 

It is curious that none of us know where the light lies, how far it is, what will be where, or if we will ever reach it.

It is a matter of faith. Faith that through the mist we will come to the light.
