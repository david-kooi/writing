Mountain Silhouette 2012

The sun sets on my left 
Aspiring me to behold, 
	Simple wonders, wonders routine,
		wonders lost in lifeâ€™s quick setting mold.

A jagged form arises from the north.  
It illuminates the sky.  
Hidden poetics waiting to be brought forth, 
These feelings rise up as night draws nigh.

My sight turns towards the shoreline. It is fading to black.
The deep, opaque, infinite lake which will be mountains, 
	come dawn.
