To Lacey
The Sweet Girl Behind the Library Counter

(2013)

Torn between persistence and withdrawal
	I think
		Of leaving things as they have been,
Or becoming something sweeter than friends.

Torn between,
	If of such things I should even think.

To focus entirely on myself,
Or to give time to think of someone else,
Or to disregard my own verse as 
	feelings someone not myself has felt. 

An imaginary fancy? 
	Delirious thoughts arisen from so much stress?
		Or real possibilities waiting to be ripened by time?

I stand on the edge of a road’s fork. 

Such is my dilemma. Perhaps it is yours.
A frustrating mental burden,
Not sure if for better or for worst. 

Yet as an optimist I’d have to say,
Not to worry about this in this sort of way. 

Not to jade this little sweet story,
	of chance and between page placed love notes,
		with drops of smile and cups of worry. 

But to breath free and as ourselves,
Resolve this we will, and no longer feel lost,
Tomorrow after we both get off.
