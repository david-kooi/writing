Mountain Side Composed Near Sunset Ridge 2012

Oh still and quiet mountain side, How thou entrance me with your peaceful
might,

How well you shadow our most prideful marks, A symbol of strength to be seen
from afar.

Oh still and quiet mountain side, What do you think of humanities strife?
Is it petty, or do we make it work?

For we contain so much potential, separated from natures cold working brith.

Oh still and quiet mountain side, When will we see the light?

How I adore such serene rocky heights, Oh still and quiet mountain side.
