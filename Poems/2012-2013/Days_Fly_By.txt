\f0\fs24 \cf0 Days Fly By\
Shell Writtings\
2013\
\
It is crazy that the days fly by.\
\
That the moment where past and future meet \
	is the only place our will\'92s may try.\
\
So we go great lengths our time to keep,\
	By painting motivations out of whisps of air\
		Which we call minutes, hours, days, and weeks.\
\
Around these constructs we build our lives,\
Aiming every action to the double point,\
And yet out of so much order we keep asking,\
	asking  why?\
\
Why do the days fly by?\
It is a matter we can only try to comprehend.\
An element we cannot control.\
\
To trust in the moments we cannot sense\
	Is our vice and our strength}
