Days Fly ByShell Writtings
2013

It is crazy that thedays fly by.That the moment where past and future meet 
	is the only place our will’s may try.
So we go great lengths our time to keep,
	By painting motivations out of whisps of air
		Which we call minutes, hours, days, and weeks.
Around these constructs we build our lives,Aiming every action to thedouble point,And yet out of so much order we keep asking,
	asking	why?
Why do the days fly by?It is a matter we can only try to comprehend.
An element we cannot control.To trust in the moments we cannot sense
	Is our vice and our strength
