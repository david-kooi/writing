Discourse With A Rock


I come as one.

						Your heart stays solid
						my friend.

I come natural, as myself.
						If wisdom is from experiance,
						you are the  wisest of all.


I come humbly, leaving my abilities for
	destruction and creation behind.

							You seem inert, but
							your presence affects.

Who will I affect, affect with mere presence?

							The effect you have
							in a stream.  .  .

.  .  And likewise, my life...	Causing changes in flow, ripples in thought,
rapids in the action of men.


							Alone you eb the
							water current.
							Together you alter
							the way.

Together we affect histories course, Not bound by the geography laid down
before us.

							You stand strong
							against those  elements
							which batter you, which
							urge you to the ground.

Mere presence is inspiration, and inspiration cause for action.

So, Stand strong with your heart, on the outside show experiance, but never
be the one blown in the wind.  Stand fast against the stream of time, and
affect it with your being rather than your being affected by it.


Discourse with a Shrub

You have tried to grow on a rugged foundation, While some thrive, you
have choked.

The foundation is passive, the foundation shows no care.

And yet you have placed yourself in a place of natural occupation.

We have tendencies to follow, tendencies to root ourselves where other have
been rooted before.

The underlying concept does not choke, it is the unorigionality which
takes life.

Life is taken by those who you think you need...but dont.

Take a step out, find your natural foundation, and bliss will show.
