Finally home. My life has slowly  wound through the first semesters march.
My tour of San Luis Obispo began with romantic notions; notions of 
mental and intullectual development. And rightfully so I seeked out people
who encouraged that sense of naive curiosity. 

Oh the joys of naivity. Let me note that naivity does not equate to 
oblivion. To me naivity is a kind of accepted call to grace. To see the world
through simplistic, gentle, watchful, inoccent eyes. The world turns in
perfection when it is run by naivity. The classic feeling of this word is 
negative. Almost leaning towards stupidity and inmaturity. Nay, it is a state
of mind that shows itself only to those who wish for it. In this sense naivity
is a personal achivement: Whilst you know the world is a hard pragmatic system
of various complextions, you take faith in your developed  intellect that 
if you let go of your societal instinct, you will still be able to function.
Indeed, function on a diffrent level now that pragmatic thought has been 
swept away. Such is the call of the dreamer. 

His problem is that of action.
