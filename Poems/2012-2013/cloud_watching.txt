Cloud Watching: A Lost Art

I stared up above for a few minutes,
In my mind trying to form:
Images that for sometime remained hidden
Until I, for a moment, left life's turbulent storm.

Still and unmoving to the common sailor's eye,
- For one is obliged to watch over a mirrored sea -
Glid past, clouds like our hidden time,
Seen only by those who see past me.

A hidden art so purposefully hidden,
Upon a youth's anticipated graduation;
Still, non-expecting, mindful, patience stricken
by high-speed, energy driver, jack-be-nimble, socialization.

But this poem is not for cynical appeal,
No, a call to other to stop, pause...
Breath, and enjoy the flat yet white-topped sea
	we travel,
That slowing down and watching clouds does indeed,
for all us,
	 matter.
