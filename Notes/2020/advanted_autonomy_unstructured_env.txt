Requirements for Field Robots
    1. Control and dynamics
        - There is uncertainty...
    2. "Mind" - Machine learning
        - For handling uncertainty

Robotic Problem: Cost
    - Need efficient computing platform to reduce
     CPU needs

** Fast learning for parameter learning

Robotic Motivation: Selective breeding for crops
    - How to breed crops fo better yields?
    - Currently: Requires manual measurements
    - Soution: Robots
        - How to make economical?
            -I.e, no super sensors 

Challenge: Wheel slip, unknown traction
    - Extended Kalman Filter 
        - Good for linear

Nonlinear moving horizon estimation (NMHE)
    - Parameters time varying

Nonlinear moving horizon estimation (NMHE)
    - Parameters time varying
    - Robust to outliers
    - How to reduce penalty of outliers

Embedded MPC
    - Small, Ts in ms, Limited computing platform

MPC Solution Methods:
    - Direct
    - Dynamic programming
    - Indirect Methods

Methods
Measurement -> NMHE -> Feedback -> NMPC Prep 
-> NMPC Feedback -> Control

Use multi threading for handling these steps

Counting Problem:
    - How to avoid double-counting?
    - Use Optical Flow

Roboats:
Lyapunov for parameter estimation
