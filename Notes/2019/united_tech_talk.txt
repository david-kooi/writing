Importance of formal methods

50% of issues are requirements issues
    - Misinterpretation of requirements
    - Unclear requirements
    - Ambiguous requirements
    - Requirements are a quality driver
    - How are requirements captured?
        - Usually in text
        - Trying to push model based requirements

60-70% of software development cost is in verification
    - Cost can be lowered by automated test generation and
        more strict workflow


*Definition of Methodology is important for reproducability*

Fly-By-Wire requires highly reliable and redundant electronics


Property into sub-properties

Formal methods for robot-human collaboration?


Boeing MCAS:
    - Wanted to have a derivative change between aircraft behavior
    - Lower cost of certifying system anew 


Automatic Test Generation and Applications of Hybrid Systems 
Verification Techniques

ATG - Automatic Test Generation

High Level Requirements to Low Level Requirements
HLR -> Develop LLR -> Design LLR Test Cases -> Development -> Create Tests

Automatic Test Generation
    - Produce requirements based tests

Testing:
    - How much is observable, controllable?
    - Assign inputs and assure combination of inputs is sufficient
      to test component internals
    - How to minimize # of tests required for confidence?
    - How to sequence tests to minimize time of testing?

From requirements to testing:
    - Generate cases where pre-condition is true
    - Test post-condition 


STL -> Simulink Spec Model
    - Done by hand

Requirements Defined in "Control Natural Language"


Hybrid Systems

Ideal Analysis:
    - Compute reachability set

Alternativly: 
    - Compute "meaningful" part of reachability set
    - Find the regions in state space where preconditions of requirements are met 
    - Use falsification to find inputs that lead you to a certain region

Hybrid Verification
    - Semi-decidable
    - Lack of standards
    - Lookup tables for hybrid systems?

Requirements ought to be complete: Deterministic and Consistent
