- Most likely failure
- Modes
- Probability

In-Situ testing is not feasible
Use simulations to test
    - Tradeoff beween fidelity and tractability

How to make simnulation tractable?
    - How can you test low probability situations
Approximate search to find situations that lead to failure.

Adaptive Stress Testing
    - Probabalistic envirionment
    - Reinforcement learning to maximize failure of system
        - Reward high probabibility actions  

Paper: ACAS X
    - Find most probable edge case situations 

Categorization with Temporal Logic
    - Temporal logic decision trees to evaluate the time series 
    - STL because it handles time traces
    - 

-> Interperable Categorization of Heterogenous Time Series Data 


*How to find sufficient temporal logic expressions that cause failure?
