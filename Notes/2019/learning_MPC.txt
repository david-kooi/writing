Self driving car investment: 120 billion
Importance of constraints, prediction, and learning

Conference: Learning for Dynamics and Control (L4DC)

Constraint satisfaction is important

Predictive control: Theory, Computation, Practice

HJB Toolbox: A Toolbox for Level Set Methods

Offline methods: Difficult for more than 5 states
Online methods:  Compute optimization in real-time 
    * Tesla Autopilot uses a quadratic program 
    * SpaceX uses convex optimization 
        Mattingly and ...

    * If convex can do real-time 


1. Skill Acquisition: Learning
    - Learn from demonstration
2. Performance Improvement: Iterative Learning
    - Control: Assume a control invariant set 
    - Reinforcment learning: Sub-optimal solutions
3. Reduce Computational Load: Learning to memorization
    - Looktable geneartion


Iterative Learning Model Predictive Control

Barycentric Approximation

** If you have good model you can reduce sample time 
   How can you use dynamics to do this?
