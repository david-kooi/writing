"Some twentieth-century artists and architects, including Le Corbusier and
Salvador Dalí, have proportioned their works to approximate the golden
ratio—especially in the form of the golden rectangle, in which the ratio of
the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio—believing this proportion
to be aesthetically pleasing. "

Every composition must be split into 3 divisions long and 3 divisions wide."
