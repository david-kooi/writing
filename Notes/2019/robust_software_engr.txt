Requirement Elicitation and Formalization and Automating the Connection with
Analysis Tools

Lockheed Challenges
- From written requirements to verification monitors 

Written requirements to verification blocks?

"Exceeding sensor limits shall latch an autopolot pullup when the pilot is not
in control and the system is supported without failures." 

How to understand the formal temporal properties?
There are atomic propositions in written specificaiton

CoCoSim: Automated analysis and code generation

"Component" in Simulink model?j

Projects: 

*How to verify Consistency and realizability of requirements?
- Integration w/ Nice tool...
- Translate LTL to tool
- Fit Nice tool to solver and present to user

*See how to extend Fretish to STL
- Write real value propositions for Fretish




*How to find counter example? K-Induction
*How to automate requirment relaxation?
