When trying to de-referencing a NULL pointer.
    
Trying to access memory which is already de-allocated (trying to use dangling pointers).

Using uninitialized pointer(wild pointer).

Trying to access memory that the program doesnâ€™t own (eg. trying to access an array element out of array bounds).
