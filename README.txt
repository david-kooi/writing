My goals for my 20's are to develop myself as a person and to develop certain capabilities. Developing my person hood involves gaining a better understanding of how I optimally operate, what I enjoy, what I dislike, and how I think about things. 

What I Enjoy
- Decent conversation
- Succinct process and unhindered outcomes
- Tight Code
- Condensed descriptions and evaluations
- Flow
- Vapid technical speculation
- Finishing

What I Dislike
- Boredom
- Witnessing awkward interaction because it reminds me of myself.
- My cynicism
- The various images culture compels us to embody
- Self inflicted worries about incompetence and lacking romantic appeal. 
- Biting my fingernails

Personal development can be driven by experience. Books provide a source of inspiration. They allow one to enter the personalities of individuals. We can learn from the success and flaws of story characters.

The capabilities I wish to develop range from poetic thought, to technical comprehension. The world is elegant and concise. I wish to develop my thought process toward that end. Technical comprehension is important to an engineer. I will develop my logical thinking, and my atriculation for technical subjects. 


A Bachelors is only the beginning for my personal development and I am excited to continue to learn, develop and experiance.
