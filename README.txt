My goals for my 20's are to develop myself as a person and to develop
certain capabilities. Developing my person hood involves gaining a better
understanding of how I optimally operate, what I enjoy, what I dislike, and
how I think about things. The capabilites I wish to develop are my writing
style, vocabulary, and engineering proficency.

What I Enjoy - Decent conversation - Succinct process and unhindered outcomes -
Tight Code - Condensed descriptions and evaluations - Flow - Vapid technical
speculation - Finishing

What I Dislike - Boredom - Witnessing awkward interaction because it reminds me
of myself.  - My cynicism - The various images culture compels us to embody
- Self inflicted worries about incompetence and lacking romantic appeal.
- Biting my fingernails

Framework of Mind - Christ


Personal development can be driven by experience. Books provide a source
of inspiration. They allow one to enter the personalities of individuals.
We can learn from the success and flaws of story characters.
