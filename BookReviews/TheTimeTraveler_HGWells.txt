Another wonderful solitary day during my winter break.

I am refreshed by this new wave of thought that has been so lacking in my
last couple months in San Luis Obispo.

I just finished the Time Traveler by H.G Wells. This is a book that I plan
read to my children when that phase in life comes to pass.

But yes, it is a wonderful story about the Time Traveler and his adventure into the
far future. In the book's reality, humanity has reached the pinnicle of social
balance. The workers were content with their work, and needs no more. The
upper class, too,  has every resource that they need to thrive.

The ideal world in H.G Well's book is one of class acceptence. One where
social classes lose sight of their possible advancement, and simply take
their place in the natural order of things.

Yep natural darwinism at it's finest.

Except Wells hints at the impossibility of a static society in which one
ideal is realized.

The perfect social order slowly meets the problem of "perfect sustainability
" ... something only nature can achieve and something  that seems impossible
 with non natural means of design.

Which brings up a question from before I left to San Luis Obispo: Is human
society natural?

I came to the conclusion that it is. So perhaps I should rephrase my
above statement.

*-* 
A pefect social order slowly meets the problem of "perfect
sustainability" This is something only nature can achieve and something
that seems impossible with non-natural regulation.

2017 Edit:
I am dismayed "perfect sustainability" was not defined by my younger self.
It seems an important piece in the book and they key to why this seemingly
perfect society cannot last. 

My immidiate thoughts are on undefinable variablity; randomness etched into the
fabric of humanity. 

I intend to compliment this 'review' should I read the book again.
