In the end, an immense darkess resides at the very bounds of society, a fog
that drigs over every unatural esablishment, seeping into the lives and dreams
of its people; a darkness seen by only those unfortunate enough to see the
truth.

For the center of man's heart is darkness, darkness supprossed by norms and
culture. Kurtz saw this, Kurtz accepted this, and upon his acceptance took part
in the essence of this.

Kurtz's "Intended" is a symbol of moral futility; the futility of the mind that
arises when one believes so much, that to them, their belief is truth. So even
in the comforting and seeminly holy commonplace experiances, there lies a
shadow of falsity; even the best of intentions, the best theories, the best
practices, are built upon a foundation of mistruth. 

This is why the heart of man in dark: Our experiance is tainted by the shadow
of mistruth.  That mistruth stripped of false pretense, truth, is an even
darker reality; we stand facing darkness, and upon looking for the light,
deliverance, ... see more darkness.

This book certainly impressed on me the depth of darkness within the world;
like a fog it covers our cities; like a veil it covers our hearts. 

This was written during my first year out of the house. I lived in
San Luis Obispo in a college appartment hovel filled with beer, drugs, 
and paraphilia. 

My room was a sanctuary from my loud, exstacy seeking housemates. 

I remember finishing the book in a donut shop down the street. The book
deeply moved me and within the mood of it's dispair I wrote the above reflections. 

I certainly would like to give a better exposition of the book's contents 
and story. Hopefully the book will fall into my hands again.
