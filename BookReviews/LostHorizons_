Remarks on Lost Horizon by James Hilton

Lost Horizon is an incredible expositionon a multitude of implicit intellectual 
inquiry. Hilton leads the reader past these various pathways and leaves enough
of a marker for the reader to understand the weight of importance an avenue of thought
has on an element of the plot and to the importance of that intellectual element
on real historical consequences and possibilities. 

As with many well crafted pieces of expression, Hilton too appeals to more than 
intellectual senses. He foils and compliments his characters to create well founded humor and authentic sentimentality. 

These remarks begin with a summary of events and characters. After the narrative
backdrop is set, the intellectual aspects of 

The influences of perception,
The trajectory of world history,
The constituents of a worthwhile life, and finally,
The relations between faith and rationality.

Lost Horizon is a story of four individuals whose fates are joined when the plane they are traveling on is hijacked and flown to a remote vally deep within the Himilayas.

Conways, Mallison, Barnard, and 

Conway is an idylic protagonist who does not seem to have any flaws. He is an 
Oxford graduate, knows nine languages, plays the piano, is affable, soft spoken,
commanding and assertive in moments of crisis and equally relaxed and accepting
in moments of crisis. He is also a Royal Air Force pilot. Of course, he is 
portrayed as 'simple'.
