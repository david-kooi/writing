Remarks on Lost Horizon by James Hilton

Lost Horizon is an incredible expositionon a multitude of implicit intellectual 
inquiry. Hilton leads the reader past these various pathways and leaves enough
of a marker for the reader to understand the weight of importance an avenue of thought
has on an element of the plot and to the importance of that intellectual element
on real historical consequences and possibilities. 

As with many well crafted pieces of expression, Hilton too appeals to more than 
intellectual senses. He foils and compliments his characters to create well founded humor and authentic sentimentality. 

These remarks begin with a summary of events and characters. After the narrative
backdrop is set, the intellectual aspects of 

The influences of perception,
The trajectory of world history,
The constituents of a worthwhile life, and finally,
The relations between faith and rationality.

Lost Horizon is a story of four individuals whose fates are joined when the plane they are traveling on is hijacked and flown to a remote vally deep within the Himilayas.

Conway, Mallison, Barnard, and ___ are at the British military base at Baskul.
Conway and Mallison are on duty, ___ is a missionary, and Barnard claims to be 
prospecting for oil. Barnard is the only American. The rest are English. 

Mallison is young and is driven my visions of 'success'. His motivations are
heavily invested in the future and he is vervously troubled if his intended future 
differs from his actual future. This is in remarkable contrast with Conway's disposition.

Conwat is a handsome, intelligent, Oxford graduate and a Royal British Airforce pilot.
He is also multilingual and plays the piano. Conway is affable, soft spoken,
assertive and composed in moments of crisis. Yet, despite his suavity ...
 
Barnard is a mysterious fellow. He is pleasant and agreeable. ...

The plane they are on crash lands. The kidnapping pilot is killed on impact. 
Deep within the steep valleys and mountains of Tibet, he four begin planning for
their survival. The odds are very slim: The plane is broken, they have no winter
clothes, no food, no water, and no sense of direction. 

Fortunatly, a caravan of Tibetian monks appear on the crash site. They have food,
wine, clothing, and a settlement as their destination. Mallison is anxious and
is not won by food and drink. He wants scheduled path to the British Consulate
in India. Conway, who sees no other option than to follow the monks is content 
 to follow.
