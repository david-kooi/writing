Remarks on Lost Horizon by James Hilton

Lost Horizon is an incredible expositionon a multitude of implicit intellectual 
inquiry. Hilton leads the reader past these various pathways and leaves enough
of a marker for the reader to understand the weight of importance an avenue of thought
has on an element of the plot and to the importance of that intellectual element
on real historical consequences and possibilities. 

As with many well crafted pieces of expression, Hilton too appeals to more than 
intellectual senses. He foils and compliments his characters to create well founded humor and authentic sentimentality. 

These remarks begin with a summary of events and characters. After the narrative
backdrop is set, the intellectual aspects of 

The influences of perception,
The trajectory of world history,
The constituents of a worthwhile life, and finally,
The relations between faith and rationality.

Lost Horizon is a story of four individuals whose fates are joined when the plane they are traveling on is hijacked and flown to a remote vally deep within the Himilayas.

Conway, Mallison, Barnard, and ___ are at the British military base at Baskul.
Conway and Mallison are on duty, ___ is a missionary, and Barnard claims to be 
prospecting for oil. Barnard is the only American. The rest are English. 

Mallison is young and is driven my visions of 'success'. His motivations are
heavily invested in the future and he is vervously troubled if his intended future 
differs from his actual future. This is in remarkable contrast with Conway's disposition.

Conwat is a handsome, intelligent, Oxford graduate and a Royal British Airforce pilot.
He is also multilingual and plays the piano. Conway is affable, soft spoken,
assertive and composed in moments of crisis. Yet, despite his suavity ...
 
Barnard is a mysterious fellow. He is pleasant and agreeable. ...

The plane they are on crash lands. The kidnapping pilot is killed on impact. 
Deep within the steep valleys and mountains of Tibet, he four begin planning for
their survival. The odds are very slim: The plane is broken, they have no winter
clothes, no food, no water, and no sense of direction. 

Fortunatly, a caravan of Tibetian monks appear on the crash site. They have food,
wine, clothing, and a settlement as their destination. Mallison is anxious and
is not won by food and drink. He wants scheduled path to the British Consulate
in India. Conway, who sees no other option than to follow the monks is content 
 to follow. 
 
 The monks bring them to their monastery and say that they may leave when the 
 next caravan comes in. But they are warned that the next arrival might be in
 one or two months. Untill that time they are free to use the monastery facilities. 
 
 ...
 
 One night Conway meets the head monk. They have tea and the head monk explains 
 why their group has been kidnapped: To continue the monastery's tradition. The 
 monastery inhabitants have discovered how to slow down aging. The head monk is
 over two hundred years old. But eventually everyone passes away. New people are
 needed to replace the aging monks. 
 
 The monk tells Conway that it is a hard reality to accept. Their life in the
 world is over and they will 'forever' live in the valley. Conway is told that
 the sadness usually passes after five years because "human affection [to the 
 world] becomes a fragrance of melencholy to enjoy after a long absense [to the 
 world].
 
 This is intriguing to Conway because appart from being young and intelligent, 
 he is also completly apathetic. He has lived his passions and has fallen in love.
 Conway has also seem the worst of humanity during his duty between 1914 and
 1917. What better place than to retire than among mountains in peacefulness 
 and contentment? 
 
 Conway says that staying at the monastery suits him. But it is hard for him to
 imagine a life of two hundred years without an ultimate purpose. This is a small
 matter, he says, for he tends to take his fate day by day.
 
 
 It is during the questionings of ultimate purpose that the head monk reveals 
 the monastery's ultimate purpose.The world and it's passions will eventually 
 take over the ground, sea, and air. The art of homicide will become perfected
 and a single soldier will take down medevil armies. Everything precious in the
 world is in danger from the machine driven man. 
 
 The hope of the monastery is to remain hidden and neglected among the mountains. 
 The monks would remain among their books, music, and meditations until "all the
 strong had slain each other. Then the meek would inherit the earth."
 
 This ultimate purpose satisfies Conway to mountain confinement. Rather, he might
 say, mountain sanctuary.
