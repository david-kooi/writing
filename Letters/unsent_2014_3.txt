To Trent Berner

I said farewell to a good friend today.

Good by to his company: In life and on the trail.  When an experience is
shared between individuals, over and over again, the bond between those
individuals is strengthened.  We push each other up the hills. We share
encouragement for a common passion and share joy in another’s excitement.

Trent if off to start a new part of his life. A part that has been a distant
target these past months. And I wish him the best. May the call of the trail
forever pull your heard and the rush of gravity never grow old.
