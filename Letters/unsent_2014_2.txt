To A Visitor
(Unsent)
2014

Hope you slept well.

Enjoy this humble breakfast if you wish. The fish is local…we got it from a nearby lake. 

You have a genuine spirit which is why I felt so comfortable letting you stay the night. 

I look forward to hanging out, jamming out, and letting people think our minds are out…
of phase. Really being a little crazy simple means we are enjoying our humanity. 

Much Love,

David K
