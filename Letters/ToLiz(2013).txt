Country Reflections
2013

Hello dear friend,

Or one could greet ya’ with one hand on a belt loop and another tipping the rim of a hat. Then you’d ask me how the day’s been going’, and I’d start trotting along bout how last week I helped good man Pete raise come states using a come-along, chains, vice grips, and a piece of wood. Ya see: states are friendly with the ground. So they take some coaxing’. 

I’d ask ya bout yourself and you would give me a ramble boyt the stock or how it’s great the sky is drinking’. 

Ain’t gonna lie, this here county living aint to shabby. 

Yea, slowed down life has been interesting. The most surprising is when you forget it’s pace isn’t LA or SF. I’ve only briefly touched cultural LA before I can here, so you probably could let me in on the it’s moments. 

And I do know people to whom that initial jargon would be applicable to. But of course that’s just one of those moments that makes a place seem unique. 

Working moments these past few weeks have been all over the place. Stuff around the house is what draws me into an open sky sort of life. There really is something wonderful about eat-work-eat-live-sleep. 

Although I’m not fully present in those types of country happenings, they still have a very real presence.

Cycling has been a great part of my life here. The stoke factor has been pretty high. Before last week, the days were filled with gnarly ridingg and great company My riding pal pal, and mate in general, is leaving after next semester. That’s a bummer. He’s got a girlfriend to move closer too, so I’m happy for him. At least we’ll be pals in the long run. 

I am happy to say there are atlas two others that I can say that for. 

Other than that school and personal life have been filled. At the moment school is in the foreground.
