Dear Anna,

This is going to a rough draft; There is so much I wish to express to you. I do not know when to start. I wish we could comprehend each others lives. 

There is still a little of that there. But perhaps we will never be in full understanding of each other. I wish I could let you know what even two years after we exchanged that book of quotes, two years after we would sit in the shade of our Highschoolâ€™s trees, you still hold a curious place in my heart and mind.
