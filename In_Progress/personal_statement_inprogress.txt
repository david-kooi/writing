Freedom is not the absence of restriction.
Freedom is the framework that allows us to fully pursue our calling.

My call to writing embodies a purity of emotion; unfettered by cultural
concern, it hopes for the best outcome while recognizing reality. This
writing seeks to uncover divine arrangement; at times it is a record of such
inspiration. My congnition is only human and connections implied may be but
fanciful imagination. But half our life we dream, so to give expression to
adjacent reality is not too silly. In some sense our dreams define us.
