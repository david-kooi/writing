Untitled August 2016

Let loose from duty: I stand next to tools and bricks
    carefully arranged on the train platform.
I let down my focus: A wooden crate I lay next to
    the building supplies.

It contains measurements, papers, reports.  No longer mine I stand above it
head cocked


I step back
