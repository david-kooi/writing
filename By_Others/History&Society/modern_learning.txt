[Christopher] Alexander himself, in his seminal book (Alexander et al,
1978), describes a pattern called “Network of Learning”. The premise of this
pattern is that in a society which emphasises teaching, learners become
passive and unable to think or act for themselves. He argues that creative,
active individuals can only grow up in a society which emphasises learning
instead of teaching. The solution he proposes is to replace the structures
of compulsory schooling in a fixed place, with decentralised processed of
learning which engage learners through contact with many places and people
all over the city: workshops, teachers at home, professionals will to take
on the young as helpers, older children, museums, youth groups, scholarly
seminars, industrial workshops, old people, and so on. This argument
resonates with Ilich's call for “deschooling society” (1971) and
conviviality (1973).
