"Every creative act relies on language. It is not only those creative acts
which are part of a traditional society which rely on language: all creative
acts rely on pattern languages: the fumbling inexperienced constructions of
a novice are made within the language which he has. The works of
idiosyncratic genius are also created within some part of language too. And
the most ordinary roads and bridges are all built within a language too....

In order to make patterns explicit, so that they can be shared in this new
way, we must first of all review the very complex structure of a pattern....

As an element in the world, each pattern is a relationship between a certain
context, a certain system of forces which occurs repeatedly in that context,
and a certain spatial configuration which allows these forces to resolve
themselves. ...

As an element of language, a pattern is an instruction, which shows how this
spatial configuration can be used, over and over again, to resolve the given
system of forces, wherever the context makes it relevant." (Alexander et al.
1977)
