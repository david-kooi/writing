Been wondering if there can be a new-romantic movement.

I'd love for there to be a second round of the romantic spirit. But it seems
the world doesn't like to work backwards. Reworking doesn't get us much: we
wait for rebirth.

Well, I suppose the best thing to do is to keep writing.

And one other thing, too. Longfellow ends his "Psalm of Life" with: with a
heart for any fate/ still achieving, still pursuing/ learn to labor and to
wait.

Thanks for that!

Those lines strike a harmony that goes deeper than 'mere poetry'.
