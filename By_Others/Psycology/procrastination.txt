How To Help Your Neocortex Help You

So how can you give your neocortex a leg up over a recalcitrant limbic system in order to break the cycle of procrastination? Try these three strategies.

1. Outsource the upfront hassles of a beneficial behavior. Sometimes it’s easy: If you’re always late paying your utility bill because it just never makes it to the top of your to-do list, sign up for automatic billing. Ditto when it comes to saving for retirement. The more routines and processes you don’t look forward to that you can automate, do it.

2. Change the present-day stakes. Remember: As far as one really powerful part of your brain is concerned, it’s all about the present. Make the right behavior more attractive in the here and now, and the tempting but undesirable choice less so. For example, to boost your chances of exercising, listen to music while you work out, join a group that exercises together, or play a sport where your team relies on you. That way the beneficial behavior—exercise—becomes a side effect of something inherently fun. You can also try to make a contract with a friend that will force you to pay a penalty each time you fail to engage in the behavior you desire. Don’t want to enlist a friend? Just download an app like stikK, Pact, or Beeminder.

3. Aim low, then ramp up. Reduce the upfront cost of doing the right thing by scaling back the immediate goal a little bit at first. For example, if your plan is to run four miles, and you’re having a tough time rolling out of bed and hitting the pavement, focus instead on running just two. That can increase the likelihood that you’ll get started and decrease the amount of pain you’ll experience that might make you fall short. You’ll also find that once you’ve started down the path, re-upping the goal (a couple extra miles after the two you committed to) will be a lot easier.
