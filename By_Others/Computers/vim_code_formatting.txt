Vim Code Formatting
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2506776/is-it-possible-to-format-c-code-with-vim

While vim is a true Swiss-knife I still prefer external tools for some jobs.
This approach is some times much more intuitive and easy to remember than using
the built-in equivalent.

In the case of indenting, I filter the whole file buffer through astyle. The
astyle parameters are much easier to grasp in a couple of minutes, especially
if you are not a vim guru. Also astyle provides much more flexibility in
fine-tuning the output.

First install astyle: # apt-get install astyle

Then inside vim: :%!astyle (simple case - astyle default mode is C/C++) or

:%!astyle --mode=c --style=ansi -s2 (ansi C++ style, use two spaces per indent level) or 

:1,40!astyle --mode=c --style=ansi (ansi C++ style, filter only lines
1-40)
