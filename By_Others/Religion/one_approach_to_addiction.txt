You will probably not like this, but give each one at least 2 years in prison. Make their heart sink. Tell them that to protect their families, they need to be taken out of the scene. Tell them that their selfishness is affecting everyone around them and that 2 years ought to give them some time to reflect. And make sure it's a solid 2 years. So if there are any time cuts in the joint, account for them. If your courts offer 2 for 1 time, or 3 for 1, meaning 4 do 2, or 6 do 2. Account for that. Make sure they get the message. 2 years is how much time it takes to get dopes of all sorts off your brain. And make sure that the next time they make any mistake, they are getting another 2 years. Give them all the suspended time all on probation. Make it so hard for them. If you don't, they won't try.

I know it's harsh, but when I thought I was getting 12 years, I turned it all over to God. I read the Bible and gave him my heart. I spent 10-18 hours a day reading the Bible for 13 months. I came out and continued. I was not just jail house religious. I changed.

So make them change.
